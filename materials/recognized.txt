TOKYO IS TODAY CONSIDER THE WORLD'S THIRD LARGEST FINANCIAL CENTER BUT EXCESSIVE REGULATIONS DATING BACK FIFTY YEARS IN SOME CASES MAKE IT DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE TO DO BUSINESS HERE ONEROUS RESTRICTIONS HAVE SLOWED JAPAN'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY BECAUSE THEY MADE TOKYO ON ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS IF IMPLEMENTED PUSHY MOTTOS DRASTIC DEREGULATION PLAN WOULD CHANGE THAT THIS RECALL IS THE CHIEF ECONOMIST FOR MORGAN STANLEY JAPAN 

THE PLAN HAS BEEN CHRISTENED THE BIG BANG THE SAME NAME GIVEN THE TRANSFORMATION OF BRITAIN'S FINANCIAL INDUSTRY A DECADE AGO THE UNITED STATES IT WAS DUBBED NEW YORK'S MAY DATE AND OCCURRED TWO DECADES AGO BY A EMULATING THOSE ROBUST REFORM MOVEMENTS HASHIMOTO HOPES TO CATCH UP ESSENTIALLY MADE JAPAN'S ECONOMY OPERATE MORE LIKE THE AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN MARKETS THERE ARE FEW DETAILS SO FAR HASHIMOTO HAS INSTRUCTED HIS NEWLY APPOINTED FINANCE MINISTER TO DEVISE A PACKAGE ON THE PRINCIPLES OF A FREE FAIR AND GLOBAL MARKET THE RESTRUCTURING WOULD EASE RESTRICTIONS IN A BROAD ARRAY OF SECTORS INCLUDING THE TAX AND ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS AND LAWS REGULATING BANKING AND SECURITIES PLAN WOULD ALSO LOWERED THE BARRIER BETWEEN SECURITIES AND BANKING BUSINESSES SOLOMON BROTHERS ECONOMIST ROBERT FELDMAN 

THE PROPOSED MEASURES COULD BE MORE BANKRUPTCIES IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR STILL STRUGGLING TO CLIMB OUT OF THE BANKING CRISIS JAPAN'S BANKS ARE CARING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF BAD LOANS FROM THE SPECULATION BOOM OF THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES BUT HASHIMOTO HAS JUST BEEN SWEPT BACK INTO OFFICE ON A CAMPAIGN PROMISE TO UNDERTAKE REFORMS SOME OF JAPAN'S MOST TRADITIONAL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS REGARD AS CRITICAL TO JAPAN'S COMPETITIVENESS MORGAN STANLEY'S YES FOR COLE SAYS PUSHING MONA WILL REDEEM THE PROMISE 

NOT ALL ANALYSTS ARE AS OPTIMISTIC END MARKET PLAYERS THROUGHOUT ASIA TODAY EXPRESSED SKEPTICISM THE PLAN HOWEVER WAS GREETED ENTHUSIASTICALLY BY JAPAN'S BUSINESS COMMUNITY HOW IT FARES IN PARLIAMENT WILL BECOME EVIDENT IN THE COMING MONTHS WHEN THE HASHIMOTO PROPOSAL IS UP FOR DEBATE IN TOKYO THIS IS JULIE MCCARTHY 

SPEAR POINT IN THE MAN'S HIP BONE SHATTERS COULD TELL THE WOUND WAS AN OLD ONE AND NOT THE DIRECT CAUSE OF DEATH AND THE STONES SPEAR POINT WITH SIMILAR TO A TYPE FOUND ON OTHER CONTINENTS WERE EUROPEANS HAD TRAVELED IN TRADED IT WAS THEN THAT SHATTERS BEGIN TO THINK HE MIGHT HAVE FOUND SOMETHING RARE AND SPECIAL 

THE REMAINS WERE RADIOCARBON DATED AND THE NUMBER ASTOUNDED SHATTERS THE SKELETON WAS MORE THAN NINE THOUSAND YEARS OLD IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY DISCOVERY BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY COMPLETE MALE SKELETON OF THIS AGE EVER FOUND IN THE NORTHWEST AND ONLY ONE OF A FEW FOUND IN NORTH AMERICA IT WAS THE DISCOVERY OF A LIFETIME FOR THE ANTHROPOLOGIST THIS MAN MIGHT BE AN EARLY IMMIGRANTS FROM EUROPE WHO MIGRATED ACROSS ASIA EVENTUALLY CROSSING THE BERING STRAIT CHATTER SAYS FURTHER TESTS INCLUDING D. N. A. STUDIES ON THE SKELETON COULD PROVIDE EXTREMELY VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE RACE AND LINEAGE OF SOME OF THE FIRST HUMANS TO INHABIT THE AMERICAS 

THAT'S BECAUSE THADDEUS BELIEVE THIS MAN MAY IN FACT SHOW THAT PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD HAVE A COMMON LINEAGE MORE STUDY OF THE BONES MIGHT PROVE THAT HOWEVER THADDEUS PLANS TO CONDUCT THOSE STUDIES RAN INTO A ROADBLOCK NATIVE LEADERS FROM THE HUMAN TELLER TRIBE IN OREGON CALLED FOR A HALT TO ALL RESEARCH ON THE REMAINS THEY CLAIM THIS INDIVIDUAL IS ONE OF THEIR ANCESTORS AND ACCORDING TO THE NATIVE AMERICAN GRAVES PROTECTION AND REPATRIATION ACT NATIVE REMAINS FOUND ON FEDERAL OR TRIBAL LAND MUST BE RETURNED TO LOCAL TRIBES FOR BURIAL ARM AND THEN TORN IS THE LEADER OF THE HUMAN TELLER TRIED IN EASTERN OREGON MEN THORNE SAYS THIS IS NOT AN EARLY IMMIGRANT TO THE NEW WORLD 

NORTHWEST TRIBES HAVE DIFFERING VIEWS ABOUT WHETHER SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH SHOULD BE CONDUCTED ON ANCESTRAL REMAINS BUT MEN THORNE SAYS THEY AGREE ABOUT WE BURIED THEIR DEAD 

BUT SCIENTISTS QUESTION WHETHER IN FACT THE REMAINS ARE NATIVE AMERICANS A NATIONWIDE GROUP OF ANTHROPOLOGISTS AND ARCHAEOLOGISTS HAVE SUED IN FEDERAL COURT IN PORTLAND OREGON TO STOP THE BODIES RE BURIAL ALLEN SCHNEIDER IS OF PORTLAND ATTORNEY REPRESENTING THE SCIENTISTS HE SAYS BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT CAN RETURN THE REMAINS TO ANY TRIBE OR GROUP CULTURAL AFFILIATION MUST BE IDENTIFIED SCHNEIDER SAYS THERE'S NO PROOF THAT ANYONE LIVING TODAY IS RELATED TO THIS EARLY AMERICAN 

SCIENTISTS SAY THE ONLY WAY THAT RELATIONSHIP CAN BE DETERMINED IF THROUGH FURTHER RESEARCH THAT GALS LEE IS THE PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGIST AT THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTE AND IS ONE OF THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE FOOD HE SAYS RESEARCH ON THIS MAN BENEFIT ALL PEOPLE INCLUDING THE NATIVE AMERICANS 

THESE BONES INDICATE THE POSSIBILITY AT LEAST THE EARLY EUROPEANS WERE HERE SOME NINE THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE COLUMBUS ANTHROPOLOGIST DUG OUT PLEASE SAYS THAT THE PERIOD OF TIME WE KNOW SO LITTLE ABOUT IT'S LIKE A BLACK HOLE 

THE U. S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS NOW HAS POSSESSION OF THE REMAINS UNDER FEDERAL LAW ALL CLAIMS ON THE BODY MUST BE CONSIDERED BEFORE REPATRIATION IN THE MEANTIME THE CORE AGREED TO HALT ALL RESEARCH ON THE SKELETONS SUCH MYERS THE CHIEF OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS FOR THE CORPS OF ENGINEERS HE SAYS THE CHORUS TRYING TO BALANCE COMPETING DESIRES AND SOME VERY STRONG FEELING 

THE COURT HAS ORDERED THAT PLAINTIFFS IN THE CASE BE GIVEN FOURTEEN DAYS WRITTEN NOTICE BEFORE THE SKELETAL REMAINS ARE TRANSFERRED FROM THE POSITION OF THE U. S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS TO ANY TRIBAL PEOPLE SCIENTISTS SAY IF AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS THEY WILL GO BACK TO COURT TO TRY TO BLOCK THE MOVE

GOOD MORNING AND THANKS FOR COMING DOWN FROM LA I WONDER WHAT I WANT TO SHOW YOU FIRST UH THE FRONT PAGE OF THE NEW YORK TIMES WHICH I'M SURE IT'S TOO EARLY FOR YOU TO GET OUT THERE BUT THERE'S A PIECE CALLED THAT DOLE'S PLAN TO BET THE RANCH ON ONE SHOT IT'S ABOUT THE UH PROPOSED AND DOLE'S STRATEGY OF TRYING TO WIN CALIFORNIA AND A EXPAND THIS IS BY JOHNNY APPLE IN WHICH SHE SAYS THE EXPERTS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE SURPRISED IF MR. DOLE IT SAID HE WAS RUNNING FOR POPE IS THERE ANY CHANCE FOR UH FOR MR. DOLE TO TAKE CALIFORNIA 

I DON'T THINK SO I MEAN CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC CONDITION IS CERTAINLY BETTER UH THAT WAS FOUR YEARS AGO AND THAT I THINK IS THE PRIMARY ISSUE FOR CALIFORNIANS I THINK AT THIS POINT WHAT UH MR. DOLE IS PROBABLY TRYING TO DO IS TRYING TO SHORE UP THE REST OF THE TICKET SO THAT THEY DON'T LOSE THAT HOUSE SEATS THIS TIME AROUND IN CALIFORNIA AS A RESULT OF THE TOP OF THE TICKET GOING DOWN 

ROGER HEDGECOCK IS THE UH HOST OF THE COMMUNITY FORUM WHICH IS ON K. S. D. O. IN SAN DIEGO I CAN HEAR IT MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY TWELVE TWENTY TWO THREE P. M. GOOD MORNING MR. 

WHAT ARE THOSE RACES IN CALIFORNIA THAT WOULD BE IMPACTED 

I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN HERE AND I THINK THAT ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT THEY THOUGHT THEY'RE GOING TO GET AROUND ON AND WE AND IT USES THE WAGE ISSUE TOP TWO OH NINE TO REPEAL AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IS THAT IT IS NOW AN ISSUE AND THAT THEY ARE FRANKLY DON'T TAMPER RUNNING AWAY FROM THAT RATHER THAT IT DIDN'T EXIST AND AN ACTIVE IN USE IT AS A WEDGE ISSUE BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA DEGREE WOMEN MINORITIES ARE NOT GOING TO REPEAL AFFIRMATIVE ACTION 

BIZARRE GIVE US AN IDEA AN IDEA FOR THE VIEWERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHO MAY NOT BE FAMILIAR WITH PROP TO AN IDEA OF WHAT IT IS AND WHAT KIND OF IMPACT IT'S HAVING ON POLITICS IN CALIFORNIA 

WE'LL TALK TO A NINE WOULD BE P. O. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AND PUBLIC CONTRACTING UH IN PUBLIC APPOINTMENT AND A PUBLIC EDUCATION AND UH ACTUALLY A GOVERNOR WILSON THAT A PHONE CALL WITH THAT NUMBER UH OF LEADING BUSINESS PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AND UH AND SUGGESTED THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE USED AS A WEDGE ISSUE SOME TIME AGO BUT IN FACT I THINK HE'S BEEN SURPRISED THAT TESTIMONY BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN AGAINST TWO OH NINE AND IS THERE A BROAD BASED COALITION AGAINST THAT NOT ONLY INCLUDING WOMEN'S RIGHTS GROUPS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN GROUPS AND LATINO LATINO GROUPS BUT ALSO UH MANY BUSINESSES WHO ARE NOT GOING TO UH TURN BACK THE CLOCK AND THEREFORE DOLE DOES NOT GOING TO BE THE USE THAT AS A WEDGE ISSUE 

O. K. THAT MR. HITCHCOCK IS IS THAT THEY OCCURRED IS THAT AN ACCURATE ASSESSMENT IN YOUR TOWN AND HAVE YOU SEEN IN A POOL POLLS OUT THERE SAYING HOW THAT PROPOSITIONS LOOKING 

DO THEY TELL YOU THAT 

LET ME JUST TELL OUR VIEWERS THE WORD OPEN UP OUR PHONE LINES INVITE YOU TO JOIN US TO SEE THE NUMBERS AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SCREEN WE'VE DIVIDED IT SO WE HAVE ONE TELEPHONE LINE IF YOU ARE A SUPPORTER OF PRESIDENT CLINTON ANOTHER TELEPHONE LINE IF YOUR SUPPORTER OF BOB DOLE AND A THIRD TELEPHONE LINE IF YOU ARE SUPPORTING ANY OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE I CAN START DYING NOW WE'RE ALSO BE TAKING FAXES AND E. MAIL OUR TWO GUESTS THIS MORNING WILL START TAKING YOUR CALLS IN JUST A FEW MOMENTS MISSILE REVIEWER YOU WERE JUST ABOUT TO SAY SOMETHING AND I JUMPED IN THERE GO AHEAD 

WELL IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE IMMIGRANTS HERE I THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE HIS POSITION CLEAR THAT THE I. A. E. A. IS CERTAINLY A SUPPORTER OF LEGAL IMMIGRATION AND HE'S MADE MANY EFFORTS TO UH TO COME BACK I ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND SO I'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE SCAPEGOATS OF UH OF LEGAL IMMIGRANTS TRYING TO MAKE SCAPEGOAT SOME WOMEN AREN'T I DON'T THINK IS GOING TO DO BOB DOLE ANY GOOD AND BY THE WAY HE HAS THIS HUGE GENDER GAP WHICH SOME PEOPLE CALL A GENDER ROLE FOR GENDER CALVES AND WITH WOMEN AND ON THE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION ISSUE UH IS IT HE COMES OUT AGAINST AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN SUPPORT OF TWO OH NINE I THINK IT IS GOING TO WIDEN HIS GAP WITH WOMEN 

WHAT DO YOU WANT TO STAY IN THE RACE TONIGHT THIS ALREADY 

Y. IN THE 

TONIGHT IS MADE 

I I. WELL I'D LIKE TO SEE MORE TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS MORE TALK ABOUT WHAT THE UH AND TO AMEND ARE GOING TO THINK UH THAT UH FOR THE FUTURE THAT I THINK IS BASHING FOR CALIFORNIA AND ALSO THERE IS THE NATION AND PEOPLE LIKE TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE THEY ELECT UH PRESIDENT CLINTON OVER BOB DOLE IN THE UH AREA IT WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT BOB DOLE POSSIBLY COMING UP WITH A LOT OF ATTACKS ON PRESIDENT CLINTON UH INSULTS UH RATHER THAN DISCUSSION OF HIS RECORD I THINK ALL THAT'S GOING TO SING VERY DESPERATE AND VERY FUNERAL UH THE LAST GASP OF UH THEY CAN UH DID YOU JUST AFTER MAKING A FEW WEEKS OF THE ELECTION 

FOR THE TWO OF YOU DO YOU SUPPORT IN YOUR RADIO PROGRAM WILL BE UP EIGHT EIGHT PARTICULAR CANDIDATE 

I DO UH I'M PROBABLY UH A SUPPORTER OF PRESIDENT CLINTON IN THIS ADMINISTRATION AND UH I'M NOT EMBARRASSED ABOUT BEING A PROGRESSIVE I'M PROUD OF IT AND PROUD TO BE A DEMOCRAT 

MR. 

AND I NEED YOUR FLOOR HERE FORMER MAYOR OF SAN DIEGO 

ONE MORE YEAR MAYOR THERE 

AND WHAT WAS IT LIKE MAKING THAT MOVE FROM POLITICS TO RADIO TALK SHOW 

LET'S GET TO THE PHONES THE TWO OF YOU SHREVEPORT LOUISIANA YOUR FIRST GOOD MORNING 

MR. H. DOT 

THEY DO A PROBLEM IS THE FACT THAT THESE KINDS OF REPUBLICAN ATTACKS I SEE AS CODE WORDS FOR DISCRIMINATION AND THE CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER AND I HAVE BEEN FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS IN PRIVATE PRACTICE AS A CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER DOING RACIAL DISCRIMINATION CASES AND SEX DISCRIMINATION CASES AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE KNOW WHAT THE RECORD WAS BEFORE WE HAD AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN THIS COUNTRY EVEN WITH AFFIRMATIVE ACTION THEY ARE USING WOMEN ONLY ENJOY A VERY SMALL SHARE AND ON AN EQUAL SHARE OF THE AMERICAN PRIDE BUT WITHOUT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AND CREATED BY THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT WE HAD AN EVEN SMALLER SHARE AND SO WHAT WE ALL WANT TO GO BACK TO THOSE DAYS AND BY THE WAY TO TALK ABOUT WELFARE IN THE SAME BREATH AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MINORITIES I THINK IT'S FRANKLY STEREOTYPICAL BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE WERE ON WELFARE ARE WHITE THEY ARE NOT AFRICAN AMERICAN 

WHEN 

THE QUESTION TO YOU BY FAX THIS MORNING UH FROM LARRY SMITH AND IT'S A MYSTERY HE ASKED YOU MR. HITCHCOCK IS QUITE A LONG COLD WAR BEHIND HAVE BEEN SEVERAL PARAGRAPHS CITY RIGHT HERE ABOUT TALK RADIO BUT LET ME GET TO THE QUESTION HE SAYS DO YOU SEE ANY INDICATION THE CONSERVATIVE TALK SHOWS ARE LOSING POPULARITY AND IF SO DO YOU BELIEVE IT IS BECAUSE MOST LISTENERS CAN SEE LITTLE SUBSTANCE OR LESS CONSERVATIVISM AS AND A LOT OF INTOLERANCE FOR INTELLIGENT DISCUSSION BASICALLY HIS EARLIER POINTS FOR THAT CAN SO CALLED CONSERVATIVE TALK RADIO IS A CONSERVATIVE 

I THINK THAT THE RADICAL RIGHT WING I HAS MAINLY TAKEN OVER THE AIRWAVES ON MANY MANY TALK SHOWS THROUGHOUT THIS NATION THERE IS NOT BALANCE ON THE AIRWAVES ARE NOT AN EQUAL NUMBER OF PROGRAMS AND FRANKLY THE KIND OF PROPAGANDA THE DISTANCE VIEWING OUT OVER THE AIRWAVES SOME SOME OF THE RADICAL RIGHT WING EXTREMIST TALKS OVER SHOW HOST I THINK IS TURN A LOT OF PEOPLE OFF AND MAKE PEOPLE MORE SYMPATHETIC TO PRESIDENT CLINTON BECAUSE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A RECORD HERE THAT PRESIDENT CLINTON IS RUNNING ON THERE IS A RECORD OF IMPROVING THE ECONOMY THERE IS A RECORD OF PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT PROTECTING MEDICARE AND UH AND THE PEOPLE KNOW IT AND THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE WITH THEIR THEIR THEIR VOTE AT THE POLLS IN NOVEMBER AND SHOW A LOT OF THE RADICAL EXTREMIST ON THE AIRWAVES WHAT THEY REALLY THINK ABOUT THIS PRESIDENT 

I HAVEN'T HEARD YOUR SHOW I THINK I'VE BEEN ON YOUR SHOW A FEW TIMES AND YOU'RE NOT ONE OF THE PEOPLE ON TALKING ABOUT BUT I AM ON THE BOARD BRANCH OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF RADIO TALK SHOW HOST I'M FAMILIAR WITH MANY RADIO TALK SHOWS THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY AND I'LL SEE BALANCE ON THERE 

C. IT'S A QUESTION OF RACE THIS IS A QUESTION OF THEY'RE NOT TRYING OUT A LOT OF THE REST OF TALK SHOWS THEY COULD TRY OUT BECAUSE MANY STATIONS ARE OWNED BY CONSERVATIVE OWNERS THAT I DON'T SEE THE MEETING THEIR F. C. C. REQUIREMENT THAT MANY IT'S A IN MANY INSTANCES UH IT'S A MEET THE PUBLIC INTEREST 

WELL I DON'T SEE THIS FAILING I SEE THAT IS NOT HAVE WE GIVEN AN ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITY 

WITH VIRGINIA ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR VIEWERS IS THAT GOOD MORNING 

RIGHT 



THANKS IF YOU THINK I'M ALL RIGHT I'M FREE 

WHY DO YOU SAY THAT CALLER 

THE MOMENT AND I'M SO GLAD TO GET THROUGH 

ALL RIGHT OR WHATEVER HIS NAME IS 

LET'S GET THIS STRAIGHT NOW YOU UH THE TYPE OF MORE THAN TWO SEPARATE COUNTRIES AND ALL THE HATRED IN THIS COUNTRY AND WHAT TO A THRIVING BUT JIM THAT IS 

BECAUSE YOU KNOW SHE JUST SAT THERE AND SAID THE WOMEN HEY BOB DOLE THAN BILL CLINTON THE BLACK TIE BOB DOLE THE REAL BILL CLINTON NOT GET ALL GET THIS COUNTRY A CHANCE TO GET TO GET HER DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS 

CHANCE TO GET TO GET THERE 

NO BUT THE DIFFERENCES IN HERE 

IN THE LONG RUN PATIENTS ARE BEING READMITTED DO WE HAVE TO LOSE PATIENCE TO TO TAKE THAT HAVE INCREASED IN PATIENTS ARE GOING PUBLIC SECTOR AND THE BEING WRITTEN IN TERMS OF COLLECTION OF IT AND THE MONEY 

GOOD MORNING 

I'M AFRAID CANDIDATES IT'S QUITE WIDESPREAD THAT WHEN WE START OUR SUPPORT ORGANIZATION FOR MILITARY WOMEN ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO UH CAROL BROWNER'S THE MILITARY OFFICERS WHO ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR ORGANIZATION HAS SAID TO US THAT'S THE FIRST PROBLEM WE NEEDED TO ATTACK WAS UH THE PROBLEM THAT DEEPLY SEX WOMEN IN THE ENLISTED RANKS PARTICULARLY THE YOUNGER ENLISTED UH MEMBERS AND THAT WAS THAT AS SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE KIND OF THING THAT WE'RE SEEING A TIME OUT HERE AND IN THE MOST RECENT A PROBLEM THAT THE ARMY HAS DIVULGED 

UH I'M ENCOURAGED I THINK THEY'RE HANDLING IT DID VERY WELL UH THAT THE RESULTS OF A NEW REGULATIONS WHICH THEY PUT IN PLACE ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO UH WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO UH ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ENGAGE IN THIS KIND OF CONDUCT A STRICTLY ACCOUNTABLE AND UH AND I CAN ALSO HOW GENERAL SHALI IS PERFORMING OUT THERE IN ABERDEEN I THINK YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN DOING AN EXCELLENT JOB GROWTH OF FOLLOWING THE SYSTEM THAT'S NOW IN PLACE WHICH REQUIRES PROMPT INVESTIGATION AND THAT UH CHARGES WERE APPROPRIATE 

NO NOT AT ALL BUT IT'S NOT DONE EVEN KNOW UH WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM IN ALL THE SERVICES UH BUT THE ARMY HAS BEEN THE SERVICE UH OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS AND SEEM TO TAKE THE PROBLEM WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED AND A PROGRAM TO ATTACK IT SO I'M NOT SURPRISED THAT ONCE IT WAS BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE APPROPRIATE OFFICIALS SAID UH THEY'RE HANDLING IT THIS WAY I I THINK HOWEVER UH OF MR. BYRD'S WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO ALL OF THAT WHAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT NOW IS WHETHER THE ARMY IS WILLING TO UH GET OUT THE BROADER AND DEEPER PROBLEM WHICH IS UH THE QUESTION OF THE DEMAND ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE COMMAND THAT YOU KNOW UH WHAT THE UH THE PROBLEMS THAT THE DEVELOPMENT EXISTENCE AFTER WIDESPREAD BASIS 

WELL SOME TIME AND IN IN THE MILITARY SYSTEM UH COMMANDERS UH HAD ENORMOUS POWER AND UH YOU DON'T HAVE THIS KIND OF PROBLEM DEVELOP AND EXISTED ABORTION BUSINESS IS DOWN APPARENTLY IN THE ARMY TRAINING COMMAND WITHOUT AN ATMOSPHERE THAT LETS PEOPLE WHO ARE INCLINED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS KIND OF TIME I BELIEVE THAT IT'S O. K. TO DO SO 

AND IT UH UNFORTUNATELY UH IN THE MILITARY AND IN SOME PARTS OF CIVILIAN LIFE OF THESE ISSUES SEXUAL HARASSMENT HAVE BEEN TREATED IT WITH A BOX AND THE JURY DIDN'T LABEL THAT WOMEN'S ISSUES IS SUPPOSED TO BE A REALLY AN IMPORTANT PROBLEM THAT UH THEY ARE DIRECTLY I'M NOT IN THE CASE OF THE MILITARY ARE I BELIEVE OUR COUNTRY DEFENDANT'S HOUSE BECAUSE THEY UH DIRECTLY IMPACT OF WHAT THE MILITARY CALLED UNIT COHESION THAT IS THE WILL OF YOUNG PEOPLE TO A PERFORMANCE AND EFFICIENT MILITARY UNITS FIGHT TO DEFEND THEIR COUNTRY AND WHEN THE MILITARY REALLY BEGIN TRAINING ISSUES ON THAT LEVEL AS OPPOSED TO THE SO CALLED WOMEN'S ISSUES AND WILL START TO WHERE THE REAL PROGRESS 

LET ME TELL YOU I'M I'M UH I MEAN I CERTAINLY A LOT OF ARMY OFFICERS IN OUR ORGANIZATION TELL US THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM IS PARTICULARLY UH UH APPLICABLE TO THE YOUNG RECRUITS IN TO A YOUNG PEOPLE AT THE LOWER LEVELS OF THE ENLISTED RANKS FOR UH A VERY SIMPLE WE INITIALLY WE KNOW THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT DEEPLY UH INVOLVES UH WHAT THE MORE POWERFUL INDIVIDUALS PRAYING ON A MORE VULNERABLE INDIVIDUAL AND THERE'S PROBABLY NO MORE NO ONE FOUR FOUR WALLS AND A YOUNG RECRUIT FOR A YOUNG ENLISTED PERSON AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF A MILITARY CAREER UH UNLIKE A WOMEN IN THIS SOCIETY YOU CAN ALWAYS WALK AWAY FROM THIS KIND OF THING THAT IS IF YOU ARE HARASSED BY YOUR EMPLOYER YOU CAN TAKE YOUR JOB THAT YOU CAN WALK RIGHT INTO A VERY POWERFUL FEDERAL AGENCIES E. E. O. C. AND HAVE YOUR CLAIM TAKEN SERIOUSLY THAT CAN'T HAPPEN IN THE MILITARY YEARS STOCKS WERE YOU ASSIGNED AND YOU MUST DEAL WITH THAT PROBLEM ON A DAILY BASIS AND SO THE SUPERVISOR THAT THESE YOUNG WOMEN HAVE ENORMOUS POWER AND UNFORTUNATELY I WAS A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE ABUSES 

B. THAT'S EXACTLY THAT'S REALLY WHAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS UH MANY OF US TEND TO SAY AND I THINK WE'RE RIGHT THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS REALLY MORE ABOUT POWER AND USE THE POWER THAN IT IS ABOUT SEX

ALTHOUGH NEW ORLEANS STILL LEADS THE NATION'S LARGEST CITIES IN HOMICIDE THE MURDER RATE HERE HAS 

THE CITY'S CRIME PROBLEM IS MOST EVIDENT IN THE FIFTH DISTRICT KNOWN AS ONE OF THE MOST CRIME RIDDEN NEIGHBORHOODS IN AMERICA IN INCOME BUSES SOME OF NEW ORLEANS POOREST AND MOST DENSELY POPULATED NEIGHBORHOODS WOODEN HOUSES ARE PACKED TIGHTLY ALONG THE NARROW STREETS TWO OF THE CITY'S MOST VIOLENT HOUSING PROJECTS FLORIDA AND DESIRE ALL RIGHT ONE END OF THE DISTRICT DRUG USE IS COMMON CAPTAIN DONALD CARE ALL IS THE DISTRICT POLICE COMMANDER 

DISTRICT DETECTIVES MEET DAILY TO COMPARE NOTES ON RECENT 

HIS DISTRICT GETS AN AVERAGE OF TEN THOUSAND CALLS A MONTH AND UNTIL RECENTLY HAVE BACKLOG OF CALLS WHICH OFFICERS DIDN'T RESPOND TO FOR MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS A RESPONSE TIME WASN'T THE ONLY PROBLEM HERE POLICE IN THIS DISTRICT HAD A BAD REPUTATION AND FOR GOOD REASON TWO YEARS AGO FEDERAL AGENTS DISCOVERED A DRUG TRAFFICKING RAIN WITHIN THE FORCE AND ONE OF THE RINGS LEADERS OFFICER LYNN DAVIS WAS CONVICTED OF ORDERING THE MURDER OF A WOMAN WHO FILED A BRUTALITY COMPLAINT AGAINST ITS CITIZENS WERE AFRAID OF

I'M JIM WIRE ON THE NEWS HOUR ON P. B. S. WELCOME TO THIS SECOND NINETEEN NINETY SIX PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE BETWEEN SENATOR BOB DOLE THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE AND PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE IT IS SPONSORED BY THE COMMISSION ON PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES WE WILL FOLLOW A TOWN HALL TYPE FORMAT TONIGHT THE QUESTIONS OVER THE NEXT NINETY MINUTES WILL COME FROM ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN CITIZENS OF THE GREATER SAN DIEGO AREA THEY WERE CHOSEN IN THE PAST WEEK BY THE GALLUP ORGANIZATION TO REPRESENT A ROUGH CROSS SECTION OF VOTERS ASKED THE POLITICAL VIEWS AGE GENDER AND OTHER FACTORS EACH SAID HE OR SHE IS UNDECIDED ABOUT THIS PRESIDENTIAL RACE THEY WERE TOLD TO COME TONIGHT WITH QUESTIONS NOBODY FROM THE DEBATE COMMISSION OR THE TWO CAMPAIGNS HAS ANY IDEA WHAT THOSE QUESTIONS ARE NEITHER DO I. WE WILL ALL BE HEARING THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME AT THE SAME TIME I MET WITH THIS GROUP THREE HOURS AGO AND WE SPOKE ONLY ABOUT HOW IT WAS GOING TO WORK TONIGHT 

ONE THING I'D LIKE TO SAY IS I AGREE WITH WHAT SENATOR DOLE SAID IT'S REMARKABLE THING IN A COUNTRY LIKE OURS MANY GREW UP IN RUSSELL KANSAS ONE WHO WAS BORN TO A MOTHER IN HOPE ARKANSAS WHO WON OF RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT COULD HAVE A CHANCE TO SERVE AS PRESIDENT THE FIRST THING I WOULD SAY IS THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE CHANCE TO BE PRESIDENT THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT VISIONS ABOUT HOW WE SHOULD GO INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WOULD WE BE BETTER OFF THIS I BELIEVE WORKING TOGETHER TO GIVE EACH OTHER THE TOOLS WE NEED TO MAKE THE MOST OF OUR GOD GIVEN POTENTIAL AND ARE WE BETTER OFF SAYING YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN WOULD WE BE BETTER OFF BILLING THAT BREAKS TO THE FUTURE TOGETHER SO WE CAN ALL ACROSS THAT ARE SAYING YOU CAN GET ACROSS YOURSELF IF YOU DON'T AGREE LEAVE THIS ROOM WITH ANYTHING ELSE THAN I DO MISS THE PEOPLE WATCHING US NOW ON LEAVE WITH ANYTHING ELSE I'LL BELIEVE THIS THIS IS A REAL IMPORTANT ELECTION THE WORLD IS CHANGING DRAMATICALLY IN HOW WE WORK AND HOW WE LIVE HOW WE RELATE TO EACH OTHER 

THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT IT'S NOT ABOUT ME IT'S NOT ABOUT PRESIDENT CLINTON IT'S ABOUT THE PROCESS IT'S ABOUT SELECTING A PRESIDENT ON THE STATES SO WE HAVE OUR DIFFERENCES WE SHOULD EVER DID MENTION OF THE PARTIES THEY HAVE THEIR DIFFERENCES WE ALL AGREE TO BE PRETTY DULL PLACE WE SHOULD HAVE MORE DEBATE WILL HAVE ANOTHER DAY ON ON THE ECONOMY BUT I MEAN JUST SAY THIS IS THE HIGHEST HONOR I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE TO THINK THAT SOMEBODY FROM RUSSELL KANSAS SOMEBODY GREW UP LIVING IN A BASEMENT APARTMENT SOMEBODY'S PARENTS THEN FINISH HIGH SCHOOL SOMEBODY IS SPENT ABOUT THIRTY NINE MONTHS IN HOSPITALS AFTER WORLD WAR TWO SOMEBODY IS ABOUT MEDICARE IT AND HE ADDRESSED SOMEBODY UNDERSTANDS THAT THE REAL AMERICANS OUT THERE THE REAL PROBLEMS WHETHER SOCCER MOMS ARE THE SAME SINGLE PARENTS AND FAMILY WORK OUR SENIORS WITH PEOPLE DISABILITIES WHERE IT MAY BE 

AS ITS FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT WE ARE A LEADER IN HELPING THE WORLD TO UNDERSTAND THE FIGHTERS AND IN FACT AMERICANS ARE FAR AS WHEN WE LIVE IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND WORK THERE ARE NOT A THREAT BUT ACTUALLY FURTHER THE SOCIAL FABRIC OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL OBJECTIVES OF ALL COUNTRIES IN THIS REGARD THE INTERNATIONAL CENTER BELIEVES THAT WE WILL BENEFIT FROM LESS REGULATION AND LEGAL DISCRIMINATION IN THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETPLACE IS AS GREATER COMPETITION WILL LOWER CONSUMER PRICES INCREASE PURCHASING POWER AND CHALLENGE AMERICANS AND OTHERS TO STRIVE TO BE BETTER INDEED AMERICANS ARE COMPETITIVE PEOPLE AND AS LONG AS OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT PROVIDES EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR EACH CITIZEN TO REACH AS MAXIMUM POTENTIAL WE WILL ALWAYS EXCEL AND PROSPER AS FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT SAID WHEN DISCUSSING AN EQUALLY SIGNIFICANT TEST WE HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR BUT FEAR ITSELF 

AT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE ARE PRAYING TO GET SOME KIND OF RELIEF FROM THE SUPPRESS THE OVERWHELMING EXPENSIVE GOVERNMENT BOB DOLE EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO CANDIDATES HE SAID THAT BILL CLINTON WANTED GOVERNMENT TO IN THEIR INCREASE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS BY TWENTY PERCENT BUT BOB DOLE WANTED GOVERNMENT TO INCREASE BY ONLY FOURTEEN PERCENT THIS IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT THIS IS THE TRIVIAL DIFFERENCE THAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO CHOOSE FROM THIS YEAR AT A TIME WHEN WE WANT SMALLER GOVERNMENT THEY DEFINE SMALLER GOVERNMENT AS BEING I DON'T WANT TO GROW AS FAST AS MY OPPONENT DOES AT A TIME WHEN WE WANT SMALLER GOVERNMENT THEY DEFINE SMALLER GOVERNMENT IS GETTING RID OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND SPREADING THE FUNCTIONS OVER THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS OF GOVERNMENT AT A TIME WHEN WE WANT SMALLER GOVERNMENT BILL CLINTON MAKES UP STORIES ABOUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BEING SMALL IS THE SMALLEST IT'S BEEN SINCE JOHN F. KENNEDY'S DAY WHEN IN FACT EVERY ONE OF US KNOWS THAT EVERY YEAR GOVERNMENT GETS BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND IT NEVER STOPS WHEN IS IT GOING TO STOP 

SO IT IS IN THIS LEADERSHIP THAT YOU KNOW THAT AMERICA'S FASTEST GROWING GRASS ROOTS PARTY HAS EMERGED THE NATURAL LAW PARTY DEDICATED TO PROVE AND COST EFFECTIVE COMMON SENSE SOLUTIONS TO AMERICA'S PROBLEMS I AM A RESEARCH SCIENTIST AND IT WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH LEADING SCIENTISTS EDUCATORS BUSINESSMAN FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY DISCOVER AMERICA FOR THE MOST EFFECTIVE FIELD TESTED COMMON SENSE SOLUTIONS TO AMERICA'S PROBLEMS WE HAVE WITH THESE SOLUTIONS TOGETHER INTO A SINGLE COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT A FIFTY POINT ACTION PLAN TO REVITALIZE AMERICA AN ALL OUT ASSAULT ON AMERICA'S PROBLEMS AND THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE PLATFORM OF SOLUTIONS EVER PUT FORWARD BY A POLITICAL PARTY THESE SOLUTIONS TEND TO BE FORWARD LOOKING PREVENTION ORIENTED DESIGNED TO BRING OUR NATIONAL POLICIES INTO GREATER HARMONY WITH NATURAL LAW SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE PROVEN PREVENTIVE SERVICES IN OUR PRIVATE AND PUBLIC HEALTH THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR SINCE ACCORDING TO THE JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION SEVENTY PERCENT OF OUR DISEASE IS SELF INFLICTED AND PREVENTABLE 

MY THANKS TO THE SPONSORS OF THE PANELISTS MY CONGRATULATIONS TO MY FELLOW CANDIDATES WHO ARE FOR AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE WAS FOUGHT OVER THE PRINCIPLE THAT A FREE PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE ITS OWN LAWS AND IT HURT DETERMINE THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY WOULD BE TAXED AND OTHER RESOURCES WOULD BE COMMITTED THE FRAMERS OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AFTER ACKNOWLEDGING THAT GOD IS OUR CREATOR WAR AND THAT IT IS HE WHO ENDOWED US WITH CERTAIN INALIENABLE RIGHTS TO LIFE LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS WENT ON TO SAY THAT GOVERNMENT DERIVES IS JUST POWERS FROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED IT WAS FOR THAT REASON THE RIGHT AFTER THE PREAMBLE TO THE CONSTITUTION IN ARTICLE ONE SECTION WHEN THEY STIPULATED THAT ALL LEGISLATIVE POWERS SHOULD BE VESTED IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES 

RALPH NADER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SUCH THINGS AS THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT THE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY THE CONSUMER PRODUCTS SAFETY COMMISSION TO SAFE WATER DRINKING ACT IN A MEETING POULTRY INSPECTION LAWS THE MAN HAS A BETTER LEGISLATIVE RECORD THAN MANY CURRENT OFFICIALS IN OUR GOVERNMENT SPEAKING OF SAID GOVERNMENTS MR. NADER IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT'S SELLS THE TRUST OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FOR A BILLION DOLLARS OF CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS EACH YEAR A BILLION DOLLARS TAKES CONTROL OF THE U. S. GOVERNMENT THERE IS NO HIGHER RETURN ON INVESTMENT ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD HE SAYS WE NEED MORE COMPETITION MORE PARTIES IN THE FRAY AND MORE ROBUST DEBATE WE NEED TO GENERATE FRESH POLITICAL ENERGY HALF OF THE PEOPLE STAY HOME FEELING APATHETIC AND POWERLESS 

MORNING 

YES IT DOES THERE ARE UH THE EARLY VOTING IN A NUMBER OF STATES UH THIS YEAR AND IT GIVES A CHANCE FOR FOR PEOPLE TO CAST THEIR BALLOT EVEN BEFORE UH ELECTION DAY AND COLORADO IN A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES ARIZONA SEVERAL OTHERS AROUND THE COUNTRY HAVE STARTED DOING THIS IT'S UH A NEW TREND IN POLITICS AND I THINK THE MERITS UH THEY'RE THERE SORT OF A DEBATE I'M ON WHETHER IT'S A GOOD THING OR NOT I KNOW ONE THING IT MAKES POLLING VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE UH IT'S SORT OF A MOVING TARGET 

ABSOLUTELY THERE IN THE STATE AND UH I GUESS THEY FEEL THEY DON'T NEED TO SEE THE FINAL THREE WEEKS OF THE CAMPAIGN THAT MADE UP THEIR MINDS AND THEY CAN GO IN AND CAST ABOUT 

THAT'S FAIRLY NEW IN SOME STATES SO LIKE COLORADO UH ONE INTERESTING THING TO SEE RATTLING OFF SOME OF THOSE NAMES OF THOSE ARE OUR VIEW THIS REALLY KEY SWING STATES IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE AND YOU KIND OF WONDER UH WHETHER VOTERS HAVE MADE UP THEIR MINDS YET THERE WERE WHETHER THEY MIGHT WANT TO WAIT A LITTLE BIT LONGER I KNOW BOTH OF THE CANDIDATES WILL PROBABLY MAKING FINAL SWINGS THROUGH THERE AND AND I KNOW THAT INFLUENCES PEOPLE ARE NOT BUT IT'S INTERESTING A NUMBER OF THOSE ARE VERY MUCH IN PLAY 

WELL THERE'S ALWAYS A LAG TIME BETWEEN ECONOMIC INDICATORS AND AND MOOD WE SAW THAT AT THE END OF PRESIDENT BUSH'S ADMINISTRATION WHEN THE ECONOMY WAS ACTUALLY STARTING TO IMPROVE BUT WHEN IT CAME TO ELECTION DAY PEOPLE WERE STILL ON THE PHONE NOW UH AND AFTER ALL THE CORPORATE DOWNSIZING AND AND ALL OF THE DEBATE OVER NAFTA I GUESS PEOPLE ARE WAKING UP AND REALIZING THAT THEY'RE STILL ALIVE AND UH THEY'RE FEELING A LITTLE BETTER UH IT IT'S ALSO LINKS TO NON ECONOMIC THINGS LIKE THE COVERAGE OF THE OLYMPICS I MEAN I GUESS IT WAS A MOVIE INDEPENDENCE DAY SOME PEOPLE ARE ATTRIBUTING IT TO THAT NICE YOU KNOW SHOT AT 

IT'S CERTAINLY INTERESTING TO THINK THAT THE UH SOME IN WITH A MACK ARENA MIGHT INFLUENCE THE WAY PEOPLE VOTE BUT I MEAN I I. YOU KNOW YOU TAKE NOTICE SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND YOU TAKE NOTE OF A SERIES OF ARTICLES UH BASED ON WASHINGTON POST POLL AND EARLIER THIS WEEK THAT SHOWED A TREMENDOUS DISCONNECT BETWEEN ECONOMIC REALITY OF WHAT PEOPLE THINK I'M SOME PEOPLE ARE STILL IN A DEPRESSION THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATES AS HIGH AS TWENTY PERCENT WHEN A FIRE AND IT IT IT REALLY SUGGESTS THAT THAT IN SOME WAYS THERE THAT'S MORE FROM MOON INFLUENCE THING AND THEN BASED ON THE NUMBERS 

WELL SURE IT DOES WHENEVER MOODY IS GOOD UH HE CAN TAKE CREDIT FOR THAT AND UH WE SOMETIMES ARE CYNICAL REPORTERS HERE IN THE PRESS CORPS JOKE THAT THAT WHEN HE'S IN CAMPAIGN MODE HE'LL TAKE CREDIT FOR THE SUNRISE AND BUT UH IT'S ONE OF THESE SITUATIONS WHERE ANY SORT OF POSITIVE FEELING BENEFITS THE INCUMBENT AND HE CAN TAKE CREDIT FOR IT 

THIS IS THE UH THE LATEST QUESTION TO SURFACE THAT GETS TO THE ISSUE OF PUBLIC TRUST UH I MEAN IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN PUSHING REAL HARD THE LAST FEW DAYS AND UH IT DOES UH AND IN THEIR VIEW UH PUT THIS QUESTION OF OF WHETHER UH THE WHITE HOUSE THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT AND SUCH ARE FOR SALE THIS IS A WEALTHY INDONESIAN FAMILY THAT THAT HAS A GREAT INFLUENCE ON THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMY AND THEY HAVE A LOT OF MONEY INTO DEMOCRATIC COFFERS AND THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THEY UH THEY HAVE ARRANGED FOR PREFERENTIAL TRADE AND DIPLOMATIC TREATMENT FOR FOR A COUNTRY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION ITSELF WAS INVESTIGATING FOR QUESTIONABLE LABOR PRACTICES 

WELL WHETHER THERE IS THE STAKES ARE NOT UH OR WHETHER IT'S IT'S A LITTLE BIT TOO INVOLVED TOO TO REALLY BECOME A BIG CAMPAIGN ISSUE I DON'T KNOW BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THAT UH BOB DOLE WILL BE BRINGING THAT UP TONIGHT UH DURING THE FINAL UH THE DEBATE AND OTHER CLINTON ADMINISTRATION SAYS ALL OF THIS WAS ON THE UP AND NOT THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION HAS REVIEWED THIS END AND THEY SEEM TO THINK THAT UH THAT THAT THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT 

FEEDS INTO THE HALL PUBLIC PERCEPTION THAT THERE'S A NEED FOR CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM MONEY IN POLITICS IS AN ENORMOUS UH A TOPIC OF DISCUSSION HERE UH PEOPLE TALK ABOUT A LOT BUT THERE HAVE NOT BEEN A LOT OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGES COMING OUT OF CONGRESS UH BOTH PARTIES HAVE BENEFITED GREAT DEAL FROM BIG CORPORATE MONEY COMING IN THEN AND FAVORS HAVE GONE OUT UH WE SAW THE REPUBLICANS UH THERE'S A PIECE IN THE SAME L. A. TIMES ABOUT HOW UH BOB DOLE HAS GIVEN THE VARIOUS TAX AND BUSINESS BREAKS TO THE GALLO WINE FAMILY AMONG HIS BIGGEST POLITICAL PATRONS 

WELL I THINK DOLE IS IN A TOUGH SITUATION THERE'S BEEN THIS IN A VERY UNUSUAL PUBLIC AGONIZING OVER HOW TOUGH HE SHOULD BE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL HE IS PERCEIVED UH I THINK SOMETIMES UNJUSTLY AS BEING EXCESSIVELY NEGATIVE MEAN BETTER DARK AND AND WITH THAT COMES THE RISK HE'S COMING ON TOO STRONG ATTACKING CLINTON OF REINFORCING THAT AT THE SAME TIME MANY PEOPLE WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY FEEL THAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT TOUGHER IN THE FIRST DEBATE ON UH ON CLINTON'S ETHICAL PROBLEMS ON VARIOUS PROBLEMS AND SCANDALS THAT HAVE SURROUNDED THE ADMINISTRATION THEY FEELING BLUE GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY SO TONIGHT IN THE FINAL DEBATE HE'S GOT TO WALK A VERY VERY FINE LINE NOT TO GO TOO NEGATIVE BUT AT THE SAME TIME RAISE THE FINAL QUESTION UH FOR THE FINAL TIME ABOUT PUBLIC TRUST IS THIS IS REALLY HIS LAST TIME IN THE NATIONAL SPOTLIGHT UH AND AND FINAL THREE WEEKS 

GOOD MORNING GOT A 

WELL UP AND DOWN THE LINE OF COURSE CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIA REPUBLICANS ARE FEARFUL THAT DOLE WILL PULL BUSH IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO UH THEN PRESIDENT BUSH UH YOU'VE ABANDONED CALIFORNIA AND A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT HOUSE SEATS FOR EXAMPLE WENT TO DEMOCRATS WHO IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR UH WERE TURNED OUT UH AND REPUBLICANS REPLACE THEM WHEN THERE WAS A MUCH STRONGER REPUBLICAN THAT EFFORT BUT I THINK IT UH I SUPPOSE WHAT GLORIA SAID I THINK THAT UH THAT UH THAT SENATOR DOLE DOES HAVE A STRONG CHANCE TO WIN IN CALIFORNIA AND THE REASON I SAY THAT IS THE FIELD POLL WHICH JUST CAME OUT A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO INDICATES THAT THE TWENTY ONE POINT LEAD OF THREE OR FOUR WEEKS AGO THAT PRESIDENT CLINTON HAD HAS BEEN SHAVED ABOUT TEN POINTS AND IF YOU'RE PETE WILSON UH HE GOT REELECTED IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR AGAINST KATHLEEN BROWN FOR GOVERNOR UH WITH A SIMILAR UH KATHLEEN BROWN LEADING EVAPORATING IN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS OF THE CAMPAIGN 

LOOK I MEAN THAT'S THE KEY POINT HERE PROPOSITION TWO OH NINE WHICH BANDS GENDER PREFERENCES GENDER AND A RACE PREFERENCES AND QUOTAS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IS A LEADING IN THE CURRENT FIELD POLL TWO OH TWO ONE AND ACROSS THE BOARD YOU FIND AFRICAN AMERICAN SUPPORT HISPANIC SUPPORT WHITE MEN OF SUPPORT AND WOMEN SUPPORT OF THE TRUTH IS THE TWO OH NINE IT IS THE SURF BOARD THAT BOB DOLE COULD USE THAT TO USE A CALIFORNIA METAPHOR 

HERE IN CALIFORNIA 

I THINK HE WILL AND I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAT IN THIS THE DEBATE COMING UP TODAY YOU KNOW IT'S IN THAT CONNIE A PROP TWO OH NINE AND THE UH THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ISSUE OF COURSE WE IN SAN DIEGO HERE ARE GROUND ZERO OF THE INVASION OF THE UNITED STATES EVERY DAY BY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE BREAKING INTO THIS COUNTRY AND IT IS A VERY VERY SEVERE PROBLEM HERE AND I THINK THOSE TWO ISSUES ARE THE BREAKING ISSUES THAT COULD GIVE BOB DOLE CALIFORNIA IF YOU WERE TO TAKE THEM ON STRONGLY IS SQUARELY IN THE DEBATE TONIGHT 

CONNIE ON MY PROGRAM WE HAVE MORE COMMUNITY FOR A MAN I HAVEN'T TAKEN A POSITION ON CANDIDATES ALTHOUGH WE TEND TO BE A CONSERVATIVE RATHER THAN A PARTY AFFILIATED TIME TALK SHOW 

YES I AM 

IN THE MID NINETEEN EIGHTIES 

WELL WAS WONDERFUL OF US HAS SOME BECAUSE ON THE RADIO AND IN THE MEDIA YOU ACTUALLY HAVE UH A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO FORM PUBLIC OPINION UH RATHER THAN BEING A CAPTIVE OF THIS A POLITICAL SYSTEM WHICH AS YOUR PREVIOUS GUEST POINTED OUT IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY MANIPULATED BY THE SPECIAL INTEREST AND THEN THE MONEY INTERESTS OF A CAPTIVATED IT 

WELL I THINK THEY'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT IT UH AND THEY'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT YOU RAISE I I HEAR JACK KEMP ALL THE TIME TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR MINORITIES IN THIS CAMPAIGN IN THIS COUNTRY AND THAT'S NOT SET ASIDES IN QUOTAS AND PREFERENCES WHAT IT IS IS OPPORTUNITY AND A PIECE OF THE ECONOMIC PIE YOU'RE GOING TO GET AHEAD AS A MINORITY OR ANY OTHER KIND OF AMERICAN WHEN YOU HAVE A CHANCE AT OWNERSHIP WHEN YOU HAVE A CHANCE AT ENTREPRENEURSHIP WHEN YOU HAVE A CHANCE OF QUALITY EDUCATION NOW ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE IN DOUBT AFTER FORTY YEARS OF DEMOCRATIC RULE IN CONGRESS BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT QUOTAS AND SET ASIDES AND RIGID IT IS IN THIS SYSTEM THAT KEEP YOU ON WELFARE AND AWAY FROM REAL OWNERSHIP AND THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM IN THIS 

WELL TO TALK ABOUT WELFARE CONNIE FRANKLY IS TO TALK REALISTICALLY IN EVERY COMMUNITY ABOUT THE KINDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TRAPPED IN THERE AND THAT'S WHY PRESIDENT CLINTON HAS SIGNED A WELFARE REFORM BILL BECAUSE WE DRASTICALLY NEED TO A MAN THAT SYSTEM TO GIVE PEOPLE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE PEOPLE JOBS AND NOT THE CAN CONTINUE THEM IN A AN INDEPENDENT UH CLASS 

WELL MY TALK SHOW HIS CONSERVATIVE UH WE ARE CONSTITUTIONAL IS THAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE DECAY OF AMERICA ON THE MORAL AND ECONOMIC ISSUES AND WE TALK ABOUT AN ALL TIME I PUT MY RATINGS ARE GOING UP SO I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE IS TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF PROBLEMS WITH THE TALK SHOWS OF THE CONSERVATIVE TALK SHOWS BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS THE ANNENBERG SCHOOL I RECENTLY CAME OUT WITH A SURVEY OF WHO DOESN'T LISTEN TO TALK RADIO IN PARTICULAR CONSERVATIVE TALK RADIO AND I FOUND OUT THAT THE HIGHER EDUCATED PEOPLE REALLY ARE CONCERNED TO DO BOTH UH WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE UH IN C. N. N. I'VE BEEN CRITICIZED THE ONLY SPEAKING TO THE SHUT INS AND THE UNEMPLOYED THAN THAT AND THAT IN SOME KIND OF FOOD FRIENDS THAT'S NOT THE CASE AT ALL AND THAT FRANKLY WHEN THE PRESIDENT CLINTON TRIED TO CHARACTERIZE TALK SHOW HOST SAYS THE CAUSE OF THE OKLAHOMA BOMBING I THINK WE REACHED THE SCANDAL SO LOW AND SMEAR CAMPAIGNS IN THE SKY IN THIS COUNTRY THAT'S NOT BORNE OUT BY THE ACTUAL SURVEYS IN AND IN FACT WE MIGHT HAITI'S ECONOMY ARE GOING UP 

WELL I'LL I'LL BET YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT MADE 

INTERESTING THING ABOUT BALANCE IN THIS IN THIS SITUATION IS THAT WE'RE IN THE FREE MARKET THAT IN THE RADIO BUSINESS AND PEOPLE HERE LISTEN OR TURN US OFF NOW YOU HAVE CONSERVATIVE HOSTS GETTING MORE AND MORE AUDIENCE AND LIBERAL HOST NOT GETTING AUDIENCE THAT I THINK YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THE FREE MARKET HAS SPOKEN NOBODY'S FORCING PEOPLE TO LISTEN TO RADIO EITHER WAY 

BUT YOU KNOW THE ONES THAT TIME LIKE THIS IN YOUR FORMER GOVERNOR BROWN ANOTHER SET OF MARIO CUOMO AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN ON TO A FAILED MISERABLY IN THE MARKETPLACE BECAUSE FRANKLY PEOPLE DON'T LISTEN TO THAT ANYMORE 

THERE IS ACTUALLY A GUY ON SATURN ONLY THAT ALL DAY LONG WAS TOUCHING THE BELTS AND SLAP THE NEW STICKER ANAND WEST'S CHEST BECAUSE AS HE PERSPIRE STICKERS WILL FOLLOW UP 

E. SAT AT THIS DESK FOR TWELVE OF THE THIRTEEN YEARS ON THE AIR 

I AM A HUGE T. V. FAN THAT THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT I AM I STARTED COLLECTING THESE PIECES BECAUSE NOBODY ELSE WAS DOING IT THEY WERE GOING IN THE TRASH CAN THERE BE SHREDDED 

THIS IS SOMETHING THEY DIDN'T WANT TO DEAL WITH IT JUST TOOK UP SPACE ON THEIR LIVES NOW OF COURSE I'M A GENIUS TEN YEARS AGO I WAS A FREAK WOULD WANT TOM SELLECK SURE PER MAGNUM P. I. WHAT KIND OF SICK DYING AS IS NOW A GENIUS 

THESE ARE FAMOUS WHITE BOOTS HE RENEGED ON THAT 

WE WERE MOVED ABOUT THEM AND AND WHAT WE HAVE THIS IS MAXWELL SMART SHE THOUGHT FROM THE GET SMART T. V. SERIES 

LOOK AT LOVABLE HE LOOKS NOW RIGHT NOW WANTS THIS IT IS FORGOT 

THE SPONSOR WOULD ALWAYS MAKE SURE THAT'S NOT KNOW WHAT IS BEST AND HE OF COURSE IS A GREAT ICON OF T. V. HISTORY 

AND THEY WERE STILL IN THE PILOT THAT PRODUCES GOT IS A LOVELY BATTLE OF THOSE INMATES AT ANALYZING THE AMOUNT PAINTED WILL USE I WANT 

WE HAVE MADE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF PROGRESS IN THE LAST UH FORTY FIVE UH HOURS OF BUT WE STILL HAVE X. GAVE THE UH THE SOLUTION TO THE TO THE TWO IS THREE OF THE KEY ISSUES AS WELL AS SOME OF THE LOCAL UNIONS STILL ARE ARE STRUGGLING TO TRY AND PUT TOGETHER A LOCAL AGREEMENTS 

THEY DO A LOT MORE TRAFFIC STOPS THEY DON'T I'M MORE A CURFEW ENFORCEMENT'S THEY DON'T KNOW A LOT MORE UH STOPPING YOUNG KIDS DO IN SCHOOL I WAS YOU KNOW I THINK I THINK IT'S JUST BECOMING WOULD BECOME MUCH BETTER TRAINED POLICE DEPARTMENT 

THIS STATISTIC IS THE BUSIEST CRIME LIVES IN IN THE ENTIRE CITY VERTICALLY WITH VIOLENT CRIMES SO WE DO HAVE A TREMENDOUS CRIME PROBLEM HERE THAT WE'RE JUST STARTING TO BE ABLE TO ATTACK 

THERE IS IN RATHER IS TO BUILD SELLING HE IS CONTINUES 

WE HEAR COMPLAINTS ALL THE TIME AT DISK IN THAT CITY AND BE HONEST IF I WOULD TELL YOU THAT UH PEOPLE MORE COMFORTABLE BECAUSE IN MY POSITION THAT I SPEAK A LOT OF PEOPLE AND THEN WE HEAR THE SAME STORIES OVER PEOPLE THUS DO YOU LOOK FOR IT TO WALL STREET AT NIGHT NOT IN THE DAYTIME 

CARJACKINGS WORKLOAD IN THAT SO IS TWENTY TWO UH WE BASICALLY ARE PAINFUL WELL WHAT'S PRETTY GOOD AND WE HAVE 

AND WE WENT THROUGH A PERIOD WHERE WE WOULD NOT DEPLOY NOW OFFICES PROPERLY YOU DIDN'T ALWAYS SEE PLEASE PLEASE OFFICES AND IN SOME OF THE HIGH CRIME AREAS AND THEN YOU START TO SEE A UH A STEADY STREAM OF OFFICES AND SOME OF THE HIGH CRIME NEIGHBORHOOD SO THE SYSTEM THAT'S GOT TO FEEL A LOT SAFER NOW WHETHER OR NOT HE WILL EVER FEEL A HUNDRED PERCENT SAFE I DON'T THINK THAT'LL EVER HAPPEN IN AMERICA BUT I THINK THERE'S SOME COMFORT LEVEL THAT PEOPLE HAVE WHEN THEY START TO SEE PLEASE CALL US AND PLEASE OFFICES WALK WITH THE 

HOW WIDESPREAD IS THIS PROBLEM 

HOW'S THE ARMY HANDLING A PROBLEM SO FAR 

THE ARMY CHOSE TO HOLD A NEWS CONFERENCE TO PUBLICIZE THE INVESTIGATIONS WHICH SEEMS UNUSUAL WHAT WOULD THIS HAVE BEEN DONE IN THE PAST 

WHAT DO YOU MEAN 

MA'AM 

THIS APPEAR TO BE A PROBLEM AFFECTING SOME MORE RECRUITS THEN UH AFFECTING WOMEN OF SERVE LONGER 

SO THIS IS ABUSE OF AUTHORITY AS WELL 

YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH 

THE IDEA OF DEVELOPING THE REGION'S ECONOMY SO THAT EVERYONE HAS AN ECONOMIC STAKE IN MAINTAINING PEACEFUL RELATIONS IS NOT A VIABLE ONE 

TWO YEARS AGO IN CASABLANCA OF SHIMON PERES OUTLINED UH HM HM VISION FOR A REGIONAL COMMON MARKET IS THAT DEAD OR IS IT JUST BEEN TOO LATE 

EVEN BEFORE NETANYAHU WAS SELECTED TRADE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THOSE ARAB STATES UH WITH WHICH SHOULD HAVE MADE PEACE WAS VERY SLOW TO DEVELOP WHY IS THAT 

WHICH COUNTRY STAND TO BENEFIT MOST FROM BETTER ECONOMIC RELATIONS 

THERE WAS HOPE THAT PEACE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE P. L. O. WOULD IMPROVE THE LOT OF THE PALESTINIANS THAT HASN'T HAPPENED IN 

IS THERE MORE OF THAT WESTERN NATIONS CAN DO TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC 

THANK YOU VERY MUCH 

IT WAS PRETTY EXCITING HERE YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE MUCH EVIDENCE OF THAT SO WE SAY CLOSE INTERACTION BETWEEN NATIVE PEOPLES AND INTO THE EARLY EUROPEAN VISITORS SO THAT WASN'T AN EXCITING PROSPECT IN ITS OWN RIGHT AND INTO THE ALSO LEFT THE SHADOW OF DOUBT AS TO WHO WILL REALLY WHO WE ARE DEALING WITH HERE AND THAT WAS MY MAIN REASONS AND DECIDED AND DETERMINATION 

THEY TELL US ABOUT THE NATURE MIGRATIONS TO THE NEW WORLD AND ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF THE PEOPLE WHO CAME TO THE NEW WORLD CAN ABOUT THE RELATED THIS TO OTHER POPULATIONS OF THEIR TIME SO IT'S A CONSIDERED TO BE A KIND OF UH NOT ONLY NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL SIGNIFICANT 

I HAVE UH IT'S THE STORY ENTITLED EX PROSECUTOR IT'S DOLE FOR PART OF THE DAY 

DO YOU KNOW THAT THEY DID A FORMER U. S. PROSECUTOR LAWRENCE WALSH ACCUSED BOB DOLE A PART OF IT UP AFTER THE TO THE FOR TRYING TO USE UH USE APARTMENT UH ISSUE AGAINST CLINTON UH HE MENTIONED THAT BOTH THE PLAYERS COURT FOR CRIMES OF UH OF THE BENCH IN THERE AND THEY UH IRAN CONTRA SCANDAL

WELL I THINK IT'S A UH IT'S TOO UH SENATOR DOLE IS THE AND A HYPOCRITE HERE HE'S DESPERATELY TRIED EVERYTHING IT AND THEN THE LAST OF THREE WEEK STAND UH HE CAN'T STAND UP TO A LOT OF ATTACK HE'S MIKE SPECIAL ABOUT CONTRIBUTIONS YOU SEE THAT GALLO WINE AND THEN THERE'S UH THE ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND 

UH THEY'RE BOTH SIDES DO IT UH THAT'S LIKE YOU SET THE STAGE IS CLOSE TO THE LOWER RIGHT HAND AND UH I GUESS YOU UH I'M NOT FEELING UH SHE CAN'T COME DOWN HARD ON THE DEMOCRATS THE UH WITHOUT HAVING BEEN PART OF IT IS THAT WE NEED A COMPLETE REVAMPING OF HOW WE FINANCE THESE CAMPS IN THEM WE DON'T HAVE IT NOW

UH HM I'D COME BACK AND PARTICIPATED IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS ACTUALLY HAVE BECOME PRESIDENT OF A GROUP OF THREE THOUSAND MEN FROM MY FAIR AND THAT CAUGHT THE RICHARD ALLEN IN SOCIETY THERE ANOTHER ORGANIZATION THAT UH I HOPE I DON'T CALL THEM THE TWO THOUSAND AND WHAT IT IS IN THE UH WHEN WE GET FIVE OF THE CAME TOGETHER SHORTLY AFTER THE MILLION MAN MARCH AND THAT IT WAS TIME TO TALK ABOUT A BALL GAME THAT WAS BEING PLAYED IN AMERICA THAT WE DID WITH IT BUT TO DATE IN WHICH TO CAPITALISM AND SO WE WE THE INCREDIBLY WITHIN A VERY SHORT TREAT A FAMILY THAT SIXTEEN NATIONAL ORGANIZATION TO BUY INTO OUR PROGRAM ARE KIND THAT AND UH INCLUDING N. DOUBLE A. C. P. YOUR ABILITY TO AND THAT'S THE CONGRESS OF BLACK CHURCHES WHICH HAS A MEMBERSHIP OF NINETEEN MILLION AND WE'VE BEEN DOING CONFERENCES AROUND THE COUNTRY THAN THE UH THE MOST RECENTLY IN WASHINGTON D. C. THAT THE TWO DAYS PRECEDING THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS 

UH YES THAT AGREEMENT THAT THEY HAVE UH THE ONLY THING IS THAT THAT THERE WAS THERE WAS UH IN A MOMENT AND IT STARTED THAT I BELIEVE BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING THAT WAS DONE OPENLY AND BEING IN THE PUBLIC IN THE IN THE MEDIA THAT BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT THE UH THE MOMENT TO HAVE DIED 

AND AS AS WITH ANYTHING ELSE THAT EVERY TIME IF YOU GO TO ANY HAD A CONFERENCE UH WHETHER IT'S A HUNDRED PEOPLE A BILLION OR WHATEVER NUMBER AND YOU YOU TALK ABOUT FROM THE BENCH ISSUES THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT WHEN SHE'S SPEAKING TAUGHT ME FEEL GOOD I NEED YOU BELIEVE IF NOTHING IS ABOUT IT THERE IS NO FOLLOW UP THERE IN THAT MOMENT AND I AND SO IT 

IT'S THE QUESTION OF NOW WHAT UH WHAT IS THE UH THE UH THE FOLLOW UP WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT 

WAS THAT THAT MEANS IS THE SUCCESS EVEN IF THERE WAS ONE PERSON CAN CHANGE YOU KNOW I MEAN YOU KNOW YOU CAN ALWAYS PICK YOU FIND OF THE NEGATIVE THAT IS ANYTHING BUT WHEN HE WOULD BE IF THERE WAS A CHANGE IN PEOPLE IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM THAT IT WAS A SUCCESS AND IT WAS A SUCCESS BECAUSE THEY WERE THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY LIKE THE THOUSANDS OF FEET OF MEN AROUND THE COUNTRY WHO HAS CHANGED WHO ARE DOING INCREDIBLE THINGS NOW 

WHAT IS THAT ORGANIZATION OF WOMEN THAT HAVE COME TOGETHER AND FELICIA TO TALK ABOUT THEM DO WHAT WE CAN DO THINGS LIKE CLOSING CRACK HOUSES 

UH AND THERE THEY ARE YOUNG MEN DID COME IN THAT HAVE PROBLEMS THAT SERIOUS PROBLEMS LIKE MAYBE THAT THEIR WIFE LEFT THEM IN THE FALL THE KID YOU KNOW I MEAN THAT IS THAT THAT THAT THE SITUATION OR SOME UH ONE WHO JUST GOT OUT OF PRISON WHO HAS NO CHANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN AT THAT AND SO UH YOU KNOW WE FELT THAT WE TALK TO EACH OTHER AT THE SAME TIME BE OUT OF BUSINESS ENTREPRENEURS THEY ARE THE POLITICAL PEOPLE THERE ARE SOME BUSINESS LEADERS SO THAT THE WHOLE REALM OF OF UH THE MEN OF THE OCCUPATION AND WHAT WE DO IS WE COME TOGETHER ONCE A MONTH AND WE TELL US IF WE TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO US WE'RE BRINGING GUEST SPEAKERS AND ADD TO THAT EFFECT IN THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER WE ACTUALLY UH CHANGING THE PROGRAM AT THE CHURCH TO BE THAT CHANGING SO MUCH BUT ADDING SOMETHING WHICH IS THAT THE MEN OF OF THE MONTH BUT IF WE'RE HONORING THE MEN OF THE MY EYESIGHT THAT FOR FORTY UH HERE 

UH WELL THAT THE MILLION MAN MARCH WAS WAS WAS VISITED BY THAT I MEAN YOU KNOW BECAUSE HE CALLED IT YOU KNOW I WAS UH WHAT I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED THERE THAT THE BRIAN LAMB AND ASKED ME WHY DID I COME IN YOU KNOW BECAUSE TO ME THAT WAS THE KEY ISSUE AND IF I DIDN'T JUST COME BECAUSE THE FIGHT THAT I I WAS EXCITED THAT HE WAS THE ONE THAT CALLED IT THAT THAT OUT OF THE GOING TO BE INTERESTED TO BE DIFFERENT AND IT'S I LOOK FORWARD TO GOING BUT THAT'S THE REASON I CAME BECAUSE THAT TO ME THOUGH IS THAT WE'RE SAYING WE NEEDED SOMETHING AND THE LIKE THAT SO THIS WOMAN ON THE AIRLINES WHICH HAD MENTIONED THAT HE HAD UH SHE HAD A WHY WAS THAT GOING IN IF THEY WERE UH YOU KNOW THE DEMONSTRATION IT WAS THE OXYGEN THAT PHOTOGRAPH THERE EVEN IF YOU HAVE A KID NEXT TO YOU YOU SHOULD NOT TRY TO HELP THE CASE OR ANYONE ELSE AND WE PUT THE MASK ON AND YOU ARE BEING CLEARLY YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ABOUT U. N. CONTROL THAT YOU CAN TELL SOMEONE ELSE AND THAT IS WHAT THE MEAN THAT MUCH WAS ALL ABOUT IS THE AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN COMING TOGETHER DOING THE INTRO AFFECTIONATE LOOKING AT OUT OF BED SAYING IS THAT WE CANNOT MAKE ANY HELP THIS COUNTRY MAKING A CHANGE TO THIS COUNTRY THAT WE TRAIN FOR THAT I FELT AND I REALLY BELIEVE THAT IT WAS A MAJOR SUCCESS AND THAT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF MEN WHO ARE LOOKING INSIDE OF THEMSELVES AND TRY TO MAKE IT TO DO THAT AND IT'S JUST THAT IT BE DOING IT IN THEIR OWN WAY IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES IN THEIR OWN JOBS IN THEIR OWN BUSINESSES THERE ARE MORE ENTREPRENEURIAL UH TODAY PEOPLE WHO WERE TRYING TO DO THINGS ON THEIR OWN DEFENSE IS SAYING YOU KNOW THE THING THAT MOTIVATED FROM THE ME THAT MUCH BUT YOU JUST DON'T SEE IT IN THE PRESS THIS FIGHT IT LIKE I HAVE RECEIVED IN THE PAST WEEK BY THE PHONE CALLS FROM LA 

FROM QUITE A FEW DIFFERENT PUBLICATIONS MEDIA AND THE WHY NOW WHY THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAND THAT THREE MONTH AFTER YOU KNOW IT'S JUST BECAUSE IT'S THE ANNIVERSARY UH IF YOU GET THE MEDIA WANTED TO HELP THEIR EVERY MONTH THEY DO SOMETHING LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME MAN MARCH MOTIVATION THE ENERGY WHEN YOU DO THAT 

IT'S MY PLEASURE AND ALSO ONE THAT 

M. A. SO IF FINANCES AND HELP THEM WITH ONE OF THE LARGEST FIRMS ON WALL STREET 

I CANNOT SAY 

RIGHT THERE 

GOOD MORNING I'M I'M A FIRST TIME CALLER I I. YOU KNOW I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUICK COMMENTS FIRST OF ALL I LIKE TO SAY THAT I THINK THAT THAT DOWN AND DO IT IF THEY INDONESIAN CONTROVERSY IN ALL OF THIS THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW THAT DOWN BOB DOLE AND OTHER REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS ACCORDED TO A KIND OF DESPERATION AND THAT OF THE ELEVENTH HOUR IN THIS TOWN DURING CAMPAIGN AND I MY OTHER COMMENT UH BEING A BLACK AMERICAN AFRICAN AMERICAN UH I THINK THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY JUST I THINK UH THE COP FROM WHAT PEOPLE TEND TO BE UH MORE CONCERNED ABOUT RIGHT NOW IN SOME OF THE PIECES THAT GOING ON RIGHT NOW AND OUT OF THE COMPOUND OF BLACK MEN WOMEN AND UH AND GAYS AND OTHER MINORITIES IN THIS COUNTRY THAT UH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY DOESN'T SEEM TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT UH THEY ARE ARE ON THE MOVE IN NOVEMBER 

I'M PREPARED TO DO WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO PASS IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE I WILL AMENDMENTS THAT UH THAT UH OUR PARTY HAS AGREED TO A SAYING THAT THAT WE SHOULD NOT HAVE JUMPED CONTRIBUTIONS FROM FOREIGN NATIONALS WHO WERE ON THE RISE WHO CAN BE LEGALLY GIVE MONEY NOW 

GOOD MORNING MARTIN THAT COLD SPELL CONTINUES AND IT'S EVEN MORE LIKE MID DECEMBER OUT THERE AND THERE'LL BE NO EXCEPTION SUNSHINE IN THE MORNING AND CLOWNS BUILDING A LITTLE LATER ON BUT BRINGING IN COLD THAT THE MAIN STORY THAT I ONLY FORTY WITH WESTERLY WIND AND THE TWENTY TONIGHT CLEARING SKIES AND EVEN COLDER THAN LAST NIGHT LOWS TWENTY TWO IN THE OUTLYING AREAS TWENTY SEVEN FOR LOW IN CENTER CITY WHICH IS THE WHITE WOMEN WHEN THEY SUNSHINE AND CLOWNS MAKE AGAIN THE HIGH FORTY ONE TIME THE UROLOGIST CHRIS EVERT WITH EXCLUSIVE FRANKLIN'S TO FORECAST 

YES ACTUALLY IT DID THIS IS THE WORST THAT NOVEMBER SNOWSTORM THAT WE'VE HAD IN MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS HERE THE COMBINATION OF HEAVY WET SNOW AND STRONG WINDS UH COMING OFF OF LAKE ERIE UH COMBINED TO BRING DOWN A LOT OF TREES SO I TREAT THEM AS UH AND IT UH IT IS REALLY CREATED HAVE A SENSE THROUGHOUT NORTHEASTERN OHIO 

BY ACCEPTING THIS COP COMPROMISE WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO STRETCH YOUR FUNDRAISING CAPABILITY AND WE BELIEVE IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO IT HE HAS SOUGHT AFTER FINANCIAL STABILITY UNDER THE PROPOSAL HOWEVER IN THE INTEREST OF OBTAINING A SETTLEMENT AND HEARING THE PHILADELPHIA ORCHESTRA PLAYING AND WE THOUGHT IT IMPERATIVE THAT WE MAKE FURTHER CONCESSIONS 

THE WORST JUST PRIOR TO THIS THAT WE'VE EVER EXPERIENCED WAS ABOUT FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND CUSTOMERS WHICH IS SIZABLE BUT IT ISN'T THAT BAD WHEN YOU COMPARE IT WITH TWO HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND CUSTOMERS AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER HERE 

IT'S REALLY NOT OUT OF CHARACTER FOR OUR AREA UH PEOPLE START TO EXPECTED FROM THE FIRST NOVEMBER UH USUALLY TAKES A STORM ARE TO GET PEOPLE BACK INTO THEIR UH WHEN ARE DRIVING HABITS 

IT LOOKS LIKE THAT SHOULD BE THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF THE HEAVY STUFF WILL STILL BE NO SHOWERS LINGER IN THE TRADITIONAL LAKE OF THAT PERIOD HE'S SEEN NIGHT THAT THEY SHOULD BECOME A LITTLE MORE SCATTERED AND THEN PAPER TO MAINLY O'LEARY MAY BE UH NO SHOWERS TOO ON WEDNESDAY BUT THAT THEN ACCUMULATION WILL BE CUT NEXT TO NOTHING 

WE HAD HAD A HIGH HOPES FOR AN EARLY SETTLEMENT BUT UH WE DID FIND IT SURPRISING WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE THAT THE IMPASSE UH BROKE DOWN LAST NIGHT IN THAT WE WERE ABLE TO COME TO AGREEMENT WE'RE VERY PLEASED THAT THE UH WE CAN NOW GO TO WORK ON PUTTING THE STRIKE BEHIND US 

LOWERING THE BARRIERS MEANS THAT THE BANKS WILL BE ABLE TO PICTURES OF PROPERLY TRADE SUBSIDIARY UH ENTER THE SECURITIES BUSINESS SECURITY COMPANIES WILL BE ABLE TO ENTER PART OF THE BANKING BUSINESS UH WHOLESALE AND RETAIL UH OPERATION THE WILL BE ABLE TO BE PERCH A LITTLE BIT MORE CLOSELY 

ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU WILL BE IN CAIRO FOR THE REGIONAL ECONOMIC SUMMIT BUT SOME ANALYSTS ARE SAYING HIS HARDLINE POLICIES FOR THE PEACE PROCESS WILL STILL BE FELT TWO YEARS AGO AT THE CASA BLANCA CONFERENCE SHIMON PERES IN ISRAEL'S FOREIGN MINISTER SPOKE OF A NEW MIDDLE EAST WAS A REGION HE FIRST SAW THAT PEACE WITH ITSELF CENTRAL AND WESTERN INVESTMENT IS REALLY KNOW HOW IN YOUR OF LABOR AND RAW MATERIALS TO PRODUCE A PROSPEROUS REGIONAL COMMON MARKET BUT THAT VISION AND ALL BUT DISAPPEARED FOLLOWING NETANYAHU'S VICTORY THIS SPRING IN THE ISRAELI ELECTIONS 

WALLY COULD BE HIGH IS A PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE AT THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY IN CAIRO 

HE CITES AS EXAMPLES THE RECENT FAILURE TO STRIKE A DEAL ON THE ISRAELI REDEPLOYMENT FROM HEBRON THAT COMES ON THE HEELS OF THE OUTBREAK OF VIOLENCE LAST MONTH BETWEEN ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS SPARKED BY NETANYAHU'S CONTROVERSIAL DECISION TO OPEN AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL TUNNEL UNDER TREES FROM TEMPLE MOUNT AND THERE'S THE CONTINUED CLOSURE OF THE WEST BANK AND THE GAZA STRIP IS KEEPING THOUSANDS OF PALESTINIANS FROM WORKING IN ISRAEL JORDAN ALL MONEY AND COPS ARE THE THREE YEAR OF GOVERNMENT WHICH IS MOVED AGGRESSIVELY IN ESTABLISHING COMMERCIAL LINKS WITH ISRAEL HAVE PUBLICLY BACKED AWAY IN NETANYAHU'S ELECTION IN THE EGYPT ISRAEL OLDEST FRIEND IN THE ARAB WORLD THREATENED TO CANCEL OR POSTPONE THE ECONOMIC SUMMIT BUT NETANYAHU TOOK SPECIFIC STEPS TO MODIFY HIS POLICIES 

SOME OF IT BEING YOU BRING IN IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE HUMAN CALLED THE CENTER A CAIRO THINK THANK HE SAID PUBLIC OPINION IN EGYPT WAS STILL EVENLY DIVIDED ON WHETHER TO HOST THE ECONOMIC SUMMIT WELL THE DREAM OF CREATING A REGIONAL ECONOMIC COMMUNITY HAS BEEN IN THE EYES OF MANY HE BURSTEIN SAYS IT HAS NOT DISAPPEARED HE DID THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CONFERENCE IN THOSE PLAYING IN THE FUTURE COULD MAKE PROGRESS TOWARD THAT GOAL BY INAUGURATING A REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT BANK DESPITE ISRAEL'S NEW GOVERNMENT 

ALTHOUGH GOVERNMENTS IN THE REGION CONTINUE TO LOWER BARRIERS TO PROMOTE FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND TRADE WAR TWO BUILDINGS REMAINED WITH THE WESTERN INDUSTRIAL NATIONS NOT EACH OTHER AND THAT'S SOMETHING THE PEACE PROCESS AND THE CHARACTER OF ANY GOVERNMENT OR GOVERNMENTS IN THE REGION THAT ARE LIKELY TO CHANGE ANYTIME SOON I'M SUNNI KHALID IN CAIRO 

TO THE MORNING BOB 

BUT NOT ONLY IS IT VIABLE BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR THIS TO SUCCEED BECAUSE SOME NEAR THE END OF A LOGICAL TRADING PARTNERS FOR THE PALESTINIANS THEY BUY THE GOODS AT THE PALACE BEINGS MAKING AND THEY HAVE A COMMON CULTURE AND IT'S NOT UH BY THAT THAT HASN'T TAKEN HOLD YET 

WELL IT DID IT AND I DON'T THINK IT'S DEAD IT'S JUST I DON'T THINK IF IT WAS PREMATURE WHEN HE MADE IT WAS UH IT WAS A VISION AND SO WAS PREMATURE AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME THAT DO WE HAVE TO TAKE BEFORE WE GET THERE AND I THINK THAT THIS MEETING SHOWS THAT THERE STILL IS A STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE PEACE PROCESS BECAUSE OF ALL THE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE FOUND SHOWED UP AT THE CAIRO AT THE TOP COVER THE CONFERENCE I THINK WE NEED TO DO IS START SHIFTING OUR THOUGHTS AWAY FROM PROFITING FROM KEY TO CREATING JOBS BUILDING HOUSING IN INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE TERRITORIES TO HELP ACHIEVE THAT PEACE WE HAVEN'T YET SEEN THE TAPES ARE PROFITING FROM IT AND THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT WE'RE PUTTING THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE SO ONCE WE DO THAT REARRANGEMENT THAT I THINK WE CAN IS IT ALL REALLY GET TO THAT GOAL 

WELL I THINK THEY'RE COUPLE OF REASONS AND THAT THE BEST CASES BETWEEN ISRAEL AND EGYPT WHICH IS NOW BEEN AT A UH AT A PIECE FOR A TWENTY YEARS AND AND THAT IS THAT PERSONALLY DON'T SHARE A COMMON CULTURE SO THEY DON'T SHARE A LOT OF THE SAME KIND OF TO SAY THINGS LIKE THAT IN ADDITION THE INCOMES ARE SO DIFFERENT TO ISRAEL PRODUCES DO IT BETTER NOW CONSUMED BY THE INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES AND THAT THEIR TRADITIONAL MARKETS I DON'T THINK IT WILL PURCHASE FROM THOSE MARKETS BOND REALLY IT'S THE REGIONAL POWERS THE ARAB COUNTRIES THAT HAVE THINGS THAT SHOULD BE TRADING WITH EACH OTHER UH BECAUSE THEY DO SHARE IN TERMS OF THE SAME LEVEL OF INCOME AND THE SAME KIND OF THING 

WELL I. I MEAN I THINK ALL THE REGIONAL COUNTRIES TO ME HE DID HAVE HELP YOU IMPROVE THE ECONOMY HAS GONE THROUGH SOME REFORMS RECENTLY BUT UH AND MOST OF THEM HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO AND AS WE KNOW TRADE AND CERTAINLY WITHIN THE REGION HAS BEEN NO PARTICULAR FOR EXAMPLE I REALLY TO HELP COUNTRIES DEVELOP AND SO THEY CAN ALL BE HELPING EACH OTHER UH AND MOVE AHEAD IN TERMS OF THE SHIFTING THEIR KIND OF PRODUCTION TO HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY KIND OF THINGS AND HIGHER INCOMES SO THAT'S REALLY A FIRST STEP ROLE IN THE DEAL AND IN FACT YOU DON'T NEED TO HAVE A MUCH MORE DEVELOPMENT OF THE P. R. I. TO DO IT IT WOULD HAVE HELPED THE PALESTINIANS GET AROUND THEIR PROBLEM WITH THE CLOSURE IN GETTING THEIR GOODS INTO ISRAEL BECAUSE THEY COULD JUST GET A GOOD TIME TO JORDAN WAR OVER THE EGYPT AND THOSE UH BORDERS ARE NOT IN THE RESTRICTED AS THEY ARE LET'S SAY BETWEEN THE PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES IN ITSELF 

THAT'S RIGHT IN FACT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF AT THIS TIME AT THIS CONFERENCE KNOW EVERYONE KIND OF BENEFIT A LITTLE BIT IS REALLY TORN HAS BEEN DOING WELL EGYPTIAN ECONOMY'S BEEN REFORMED THE ONLY PEOPLE HAVE NOTHING TO SHOW FOR ALL THE TO THE PALESTINIANS WHO REALLY ARE THE POWER THE MOST IMPORTANT LINK IN THE WHOLE PROCESS UNEMPLOYMENT THERE'S ESTIMATES THE FIVE MAYBE SEVENTY PERCENT AND IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT THERE'S BEEN ANY NEW HOUSING BUILT OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS SO THAT'S REALLY WHERE THE EFFORT SHOULD BE WHO TO BE PLACED RIGHT NOW 

IN FACT IT'S A THE UNITED STATES THREE YEARS TO CORRECT ITS RULES SO THAT WE COULD IMPORT PALESTINIAN GOODS WITHOUT DISCRIMINATING AGAINST AND SOMETIMES WE DO YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT A COUNTRY WE'RE A TERRITORY FOUND THAT TOOK US THREE YEARS DO JUST THAT THAT TWO MONTHS AGO AND THE UH THE I THINK SHOULD BE APPLAUDED FOR THAT BUT THAT'S WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE FIRST THAT THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE ON THIS FOCUS ON A U. N. MAKING COMMITMENTS OF NUMBERS BUT NEVER DELIVERING ON IT IT IS SOMETHING THAT JUST IS NOT HELPFUL AND CONSTRUCTIVE AND SOUL REALLY NEED TO DO IS WE MEANING THE UNITED STATES EUROPEANS THE JAPANESE REALLY HAVE TO START GETTING SICK HAPPEN WHEN THEY'RE INTO THE TERRITORIES TO BUILD UP SOME INFRASTRUCTURE GET THESE PEOPLE INSTANCE INTO SOME SERIOUS COUNSELING AND GET IN AND START CREATING SOME JOBS THEY'RE CREATING FACTS ON THE GROUND BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE DON'T HAVE JOBS BECAUSE A LOT OF TIME TO START DISRUPTING THINGS IN STRONG BONES SO WE REALLY GOT TO GET THEM JOBS TO PEOPLE WITHOUT IT HAVING 

O. K. THANK YOU 

B. AS IN AND PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN YEAR WE DID NOT CROSS NO BRIDGE AND THE FACT THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS TOLD THERE IS NO OTHER CONCLUSION THAT WHAT WE DID AND PEOPLE COULD DRAW ALL WE KNOW IS THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS NATIVE AMERICANS PERIOD 

BUT OUR RELIGION TELLS US IN OUR OLDER PEOPLE AS WELL IS THAT WHEN SOMEBODY GOES INTO THE GROUND THAT'S WHERE TO STAY AND THIS IS WHAT WE FIRMLY BELIEVE IN THAT BECAUSE THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS INADVERTENTLY EXPOSE IT'S OUR DUTY AND ARE INHERENT RIGHT TO PUT THESE INDIVIDUALS BACK IN THE GROUND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 

SO SOMEONE WHO CAN WHO LIVE HERE AND DIE NINETY FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO THAT PERSON MAY HAVE BEEN A HUGE IN THIS NINETY FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO BUT THAT PERSON IS NOT NATIVE AMERICAN UNLESS THAT PERSON HAS A RELATIONSHIP TO PRESENT DAY NATIVE AMERICAN 

THOSE REMAINS NEED TO BE CAREFULLY EXAMINED UH IN ORDER TO IN ORDER TO FIND INFORMATION THAT CAN TELL US ABOUT THAT TIME PERIOD AND CERTAINLY THINK IT'S A RARE OPPORTUNITY 

THE WAY THIS ONE IS BEING ARGUED BY BOTH SIDES THERE JUST DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF MIDDLE GROUND UH UH IN THIS CASE THIS HORROR IS IN THE MIDDLE IS THE CUSTODIAN OF THE REMAINS WHO IS OPPOSING INTERESTS COMPETING FOR THEM 

THE RECORDS FOR THE STOCK MARKET JUST KEEPS POURING IN THE SEVENTH RECORD IN A ROW FOR THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE HAPPENED TODAY AND THE GOVERNMENT REPORTED SOME NEWS THAT SUGGESTS LOWER INFLATION AHEAD 

BUT WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING IN IRAQ IS THE BLACK MEN HAVE NOT BEEN STANDING TOGETHER IF A YEAR AGO HE TOLD ME THAT BLACK MEN WERE GOING TO COME TOGETHER AND BE AS MANY AS THEY ARE HERE OR EVEN HAVE THIS MANY HATS OH GEE IT'S RAINING NEVER DID OUR BLACK MEN THAT EVER COME TOGETHER DO ANYTHING POSITIVE LIKE THIS IT WAS ONE OF MY DREAMS BUT I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD HAPPEN AND ALLIGATORS 

STILL TO COME ON SPACE DOUBT COLLECTION OF HOLLYWOOD TREASURES OF THAT STUFF IS WORTH PLENTY OF DOUGH BOY AND TOMORROW ON ALL STAR CAST IN THIS WE HEARD THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH DOESN'T WANT YOU TO SEE

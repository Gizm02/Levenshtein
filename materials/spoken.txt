TOKYO IS TODAY CONSIDERED THE WORLD'S THIRD LARGEST FINANCIAL CENTER BUT EXCESSIVE REGULATIONS DATING BACK FIFTY YEARS IN SOME CASES MAKE IT DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE TO DO BUSINESS HERE ONEROUS RESTRICTIONS HAVE SLOWED JAPAN'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY BECAUSE THEY HAVE MADE TOKYO UNATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS IF IMPLEMENTED HASHIMOTO'S DRASTIC DEREGULATION PLAN WOULD CHANGE THAT JASPER KOLL IS THE CHIEF ECONOMIST FOR MORGAN STANLEY JAPAN 

THE PLAN HAS BEEN CHRISTENED THE BIG BANG THE SAME NAME GIVEN THE TRANSFORMATION OF BRITAIN'S FINANCIAL INDUSTRY A DECADE AGO IN THE UNITED STATES IT WAS DUBBED NEW YORK'S MAYDAY AND OCCURRED TWO DECADES AGO BY EMULATING THOSE ROBUST REFORM MOVEMENTS HASHIMOTO HOPES TO CATCH UP AND ESSENTIALLY MAKE JAPAN'S ECONOMY OPERATE MORE LIKE THE AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN MARKETS THERE ARE FEW DETAILS SO FAR BUT HASHIMOTO HAS INSTRUCTED HIS NEWLY APPOINTED FINANCE MINISTER TO DEVISE A PACKAGE ON THE PRINCIPLES OF A FREE FAIR AND GLOBAL MARKET THE RESTRUCTURING WOULD EASE RESTRICTIONS IN A BROAD ARRAY OF SECTORS INCLUDING THE TAX AND ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS AND LAWS REGULATING BANKING AND SECURITIES THE PLAN WOULD ALSO LOWER THE BARRIER BETWEEN SECURITIES AND BANKING BUSINESSES SOLOMON BROTHERS ECONOMIST ROBERT FELDMAN 

THE PROPOSED MEASURES COULD MEAN MORE BANKRUPTCIES IN A FINANCIAL SECTOR STILL STRUGGLING TO CLIMB OUT OF A BANKING CRISIS JAPAN'S BANKS ARE CARRYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF BAD LOANS FROM THE SPECULATION BOOM OF THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES BUT HASHIMOTO HAS JUST BEEN SWEPT BACK INTO OFFICE ON A CAMPAIGN PROMISE TO UNDERTAKE REFORMS SOME OF JAPAN'S MOST TRADITIONAL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS REGARD AS CRITICAL TO JAPAN'S COMPETITIVENESS MORGAN STANLEY'S JASPER KOLL SAYS HASHIMOTO WILL REDEEM THE PROMISE 

NOT ALL ANALYSTS ARE AS OPTIMISTIC AND MARKET PLAYERS THROUGHOUT ASIA TODAY EXPRESSED SKEPTICISM THE PLAN HOWEVER WAS GREETED ENTHUSIASTICALLY BY JAPAN'S BUSINESS COMMUNITY HOW IT FARES IN PARLIAMENT WILL BECOME EVIDENT IN THE COMING MONTHS WHEN THE HASHIMOTO PROPOSAL IS UP FOR DEBATE IN TOKYO THIS IS JULIE MCCARTHY 

SPEAR POINT IN THE MAN'S HIPBONE CHATTERS COULD TELL THE WOUND WAS AN OLD ONE AND NOT THE DIRECT CAUSE OF DEATH AND THE STONE SPEAR POINT WAS SIMILAR TO A TYPE FOUND ON OTHER CONTINENTS WHERE EUROPEANS HAD TRAVELED AND TRADED IT WAS THEN THAT CHATTERS BEGAN TO THINK HE MIGHT HAVE FOUND SOMETHING RARE AND SPECIAL 

THE REMAINS WERE RADIOCARBON DATED AND THE NUMBER ASTOUNDED CHATTERS THE SKELETON WAS MORE THAN NINE THOUSAND YEARS OLD IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY DISCOVERY BECAUSE IT IS THE ONLY COMPLETE MALE SKELETON OF THIS AGE EVER FOUND IN THE NORTHWEST AND ONLY ONE OF A FEW FOUND IN NORTH AMERICA IT WAS THE DISCOVERY OF A LIFETIME FOR THE ANTHROPOLOGIST THIS MAN MIGHT BE AN EARLY IMMIGRANT FROM EUROPE WHO MIGRATED ACROSS ASIA EVENTUALLY CROSSING THE BERING STRAIT CHATTERS SAYS FURTHER TESTS INCLUDING D. N. A. STUDIES ON THE SKELETON COULD PROVIDE EXTREMELY VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE RACE AND LINEAGE OF SOME OF THE FIRST HUMANS TO INHABIT THE AMERICAS 

THAT IS BECAUSE CHATTERS BELIEVES THIS MAN MAY IN FACT SHOW THAT PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD HAVE A COMMON LINEAGE MORE STUDY OF THE BONES MIGHT PROVE THAT HOWEVER CHATTERS'S PLANS TO CONDUCT THOSE STUDIES RAN INTO A ROADBLOCK NATIVE LEADERS FROM THE UMATILLA TRIBE IN OREGON CALLED FOR A HALT TO ALL RESEARCH ON THE REMAINS THEY CLAIM THIS INDIVIDUAL IS ONE OF THEIR ANCESTORS AND ACCORDING TO THE NATIVE AMERICAN GRAVES PROTECTION AND REPATRIATION ACT NATIVE REMAINS FOUND ON FEDERAL OR TRIBAL LAND MUST BE RETURNED TO LOCAL TRIBES FOR BURIAL ARMAND MINTHORN ARMAND MINTHORN IS THE LEADER OF THE UMATILLA TRIBE IN EASTERN OREGON MINTHORN SAYS THIS IS NOT AN EARLY IMMIGRANT TO THE NEW WORLD 

NORTHWEST TRIBES HAVE DIFFERING VIEWS ABOUT WHETHER SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH SHOULD BE CONDUCTED ON ANCESTRAL REMAINS BUT MINTHORN SAYS THEY AGREE ABOUT REBURYING THEIR DEAD 

BUT SCIENTISTS QUESTION WHETHER IN FACT THE REMAINS ARE NATIVE AMERICAN A NATIONWIDE GROUP OF ANTHROPOLOGISTS AND ARCHAEOLOGISTS HAS SUED IN FEDERAL COURT IN PORTLAND OREGON TO STOP THE BODY'S REBURIAL ALAN SCHNEIDER IS A PORTLAND ATTORNEY REPRESENTING THE SCIENTISTS HE SAYS BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT CAN RETURN THE REMAINS TO ANY TRIBE OR GROUP CULTURAL AFFILIATION MUST BE IDENTIFIED SCHNEIDER SAYS THERE IS NO PROOF THAT ANYONE LIVING TODAY IS RELATED TO THIS EARLY AMERICAN 

SCIENTISTS SAY THE ONLY WAY THAT RELATIONSHIP CAN BE DETERMINED IS THROUGH FURTHER RESEARCH DOUG OWSLEY IS A PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGIST AT THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTE AND IS ONE OF THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE SUIT HE SAYS RESEARCH ON THIS MAN BENEFITS ALL PEOPLE INCLUDING THE NATIVE AMERICAN 

THESE BONES INDICATE THE POSSIBILITY AT LEAST THAT EARLY EUROPEANS WERE HERE SOME NINE THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE COLUMBUS ANTHROPOLOGIST DOUG OWSLEY SAYS THAT IS A PERIOD OF TIME WE KNOW SO LITTLE ABOUT IT IS LIKE A BLACK HOLE 

THE U. S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS NOW HAS POSSESSION OF THE REMAINS UNDER FEDERAL LAW ALL CLAIMS ON THE BODY MUST BE CONSIDERED BEFORE REPATRIATION IN THE MEANTIME THE CORPS AGREED TO HALT ALL RESEARCH ON THE SKELETON DUTCH MEYER IS THE CHIEF OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS FOR THE CORPS OF ENGINEERS HE SAYS THE CORPS IS TRYING TO BALANCE COMPETING DESIRES AND SOME VERY STRONG FEELINGS 

THE COURT HAS ORDERED THAT PLAINTIFFS IN THE CASE BE GIVEN FOURTEEN DAYS' WRITTEN NOTICE BEFORE THE SKELETAL REMAINS ARE TRANSFERRED FROM THE POSSESSION OF THE U. S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS TO ANY TRIBE OR PEOPLE SCIENTISTS SAY IF AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS THEY WILL GO BACK TO COURT TO TRY TO BLOCK THE MOVE

ALLRED YOU ARE THE HOST AT K. A. B. C. TALK RADIO COME DO- CAME DOWN FROM LOS ANGELES RIGHT 

GOOD MORNING AND THANKS FOR COMING DOWN FROM L. A. I WANT TO POI- I WANT TO SHOW YOU FIRST THE FRONT PAGE OF THE NEW YORK TIMES WHICH I AM SURE IT IS TOO EARLY FOR YOU TO GET OUT THERE BUT THERE IS A PIECE CALLED DOLE'S PLAN BET THE RANCH ON ONE SHOT IT IS ABOUT THE PROPOSED DOLE STRATEGY OF TRYING TO WIN CALIFORNIA AND EX- AND THIS IS BY JOHNNY APPLE IN WHICH HE SAYS THE EXPERTS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE SURPRISED IF MISTER DOLE HAD SAID HE WAS RUNNING FOR POPE IS THERE ANY CHANCE FOR FOR MISTER DOLE TO TAKE CALIFORNIA 

I DO NOT THINK SO I MEAN CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC CONDITION IS CERTAINLY BETTER THAN IT WAS FOUR YEARS AGO AND THAT I THINK IS A PRIMARY ISSUE FOR CALIFORNIANS I THINK AT THIS POINT WHAT MISTER DOLE IS PROBABLY TRYING TO DO IS TRYING TO SHORE UP THE REST OF THE TICKET SO THAT THEY DO NOT LOSE HOUSE SEATS THIS TIME AROUND IN CALIFORNIA AS A RESULT OF THE TOP OF THE TICKET GOING DOWN 

ROGER HEDGECOCK IS THE HOST OF THE COMMUNITY FORUM WHICH IS ON K. S. D. O. IN SAN DIEGO YOU CAN HEAR IT MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY TWELVE TWENTY TO THREE P. M. GOOD MORNING MISTER HEDGECOCK 

WHAT ARE THOSE RACES IN CALIFORNIA THAT COULD BE IMPACTED 

WELL I DO NOT THINK THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN HERE AND I THINK THAT ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO BE ABLE TO RUN ON AND WIN AND USE AS A WEDGE ISSUE PROP TWO OH NINE TO REPEAL AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IS N- IS NOW AN ISSUE THAT FRANKLY DOLE AND KEMP ARE RUNNING AWAY FROM OR THEY WOULD RATHER THAT IT DID NOT EXIST AND THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO USE IT AS A WEDGE ISSUE BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY WOMEN AND MINORITIES ARE NOT GOING TO REPEAL AFFIRMATIVE ACTION 

MS. ALLREAD GIVE US AN I- I- AN IDEA FOR THE VIEWERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHO MAY NOT BE FAMILIAR WITH PROP TWO OH NINE WHAT IT IS AND WHAT KIND OF IMPACT IT IS HAVING ON POLITICS IN CALIFORNIA 

WELL PROP TWO OH NINE WOULD REPEAL AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN PUBLIC CONTRACTING IN PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT AND IN PUBLIC EDUCATION AND ACTUALLY GOVERNOR WILSON DID A PHONE CALL WITH A NUMBER OF LEADING BUSINESS PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AND SUGGESTED THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE USED AS A WEDGE ISSUE SOME TIME AGO BUT IN FACT I THINK HE HAS BEEN SURPRISED THAT SO MANY BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN AGAINST TWO OH NINE AND THERE IS BR- A BROAD BASED COALITION AGAINST IT NOT ONLY INCLUDING WOMEN'S RIGHTS GROUPS AND AFRICAN AMERICAN GROUPS AND LATINO AND LATINA GROUPS BUT ALSO MANY BUSINESSES WHO WHO ARE NOT GOING TO TURN BACK THE CLOCK AND THEREFORE DOLE DOES NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO USE THAT AS A WEDGE ISSUE 

MISTER HEDGECOCK IS TH- IS THAT A COR- IS THAT AN ACCURATE ASSESSMENT IN YOUR ACCOUNT AND HOW DO YOU SEE IT ARE THERE PO- POLLS OUT THERE SAYING HOW THAT PROPOSITION IS LOOKING 

DO YOU THINK HE WILL DO THAT 

LET ME JUST TELL OUR VIEWERS THAT WE ARE GOING TO OPEN UP OUR PHONE LINES AND INVITE YOU TO JOIN US YOU WILL SEE THE NUMBERS AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SCREEN WE HAVE DIVIDED IT SO THAT WE HAVE ONE TELEPHONE LINE IF YOU ARE A SUPPORTER OF PRESIDENT CLINTON ANOTHER TELEPHONE LINE IF YOU ARE A SUPPORTER OF BOB DOLE AND A THIRD TELEPHONE LINE IF YOU ARE SUPPORTING ANY OF THE OTHER CANDIDATES IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE YOU CAN START DIALING NOW WE ARE ALSO BE TAKING FAXES AND EMAIL FOR OUR TWO GUESTS THIS MORNING WE WILL START TAKING YOUR CALLS IN JUST A FEW MOMENTS MS. ALLRED YOU WERE YOU WERE JUST ABOUT TO SAY SOMETHING AND I I JUMPED IN THERE GO AHEAD 

WELL I- IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE IMMIGRANTS HERE AND I THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE HIS POSITION CLEAR THAT HE IS CERTAINLY SUPPORTIVE OF LEGAL IMMIGRATION AND HE HAS MADE MANY EFFORTS TO TO COMBAT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND SO AGAIN TRYING TO MAKE SCAPEGOATS OF OF LEGAL IMMIGRANTS TRYING TO MAKE SCAPEGOATS OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES I DO NOT THINK IS GOING TO DO BOB DOLE ANY GOOD AND BY THE WAY HE HAS THIS HUGE GENDER GAP WHICH SOME PEOPLE CALL A GENDER GULF OR A GENDER CHASM WITH WOMEN AND ON THE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION ISSUE IF IF HE COMES OUT AGAINST AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN SUPPORT OF TWO OH NINE I THINK THAT IS JUST GOING TO WIDEN HIS GAP WITH WOMEN 

WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE IN THE RACE TONIGHT MS. ALLRED 

WELL IN THE 

TONIGHT EXCUSE ME 

WELL I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES I THINK THAT IS WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS MORE TALK ABOUT WHAT THE TWO MEN ARE GOING TO THINK OF FOR THE FUTURE BECAUSE I THINK ESPECIALLY FOR CALIFORNIA AND AND ALSO FOR THE REST OF THE NATION PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE IF THEY ELECT PRESIDENT CLINTON OVER BOB DOLE IN THE I- I- WE HAVE HEARD A LOT ABOUT BOB DOLE POSSIBLY COMING UP WITH A LOT OF ATTACKS ON PRESIDENT CLINTON INSULTS RATHER THAN DISCUSSION OF HIS RECORD I THINK ALL OF THAT IS GOING TO SEEM VERY DESPERATE VERY FUTILE THE LAST GASP OF OF A CANDIDATE WHO IS JUST NOT GOING TO MAKE IT IN A FEW WEEKS AT THE ELECTION 

FOR THE TWO OF YOU DO YOU SUPPORT IN YOUR RADIO PROGRAM THE A A PARTICULAR CANDIDATE 

I DO I AM PROUDLY A SUPPORTER OF PRESIDENT CLINTON AND THIS ADMINISTRATION AND I AM NOT EMBARRASSED ABOUT BEING A PROGRESSIVE I AM PROUD OF IT AND PROUD TO BE A DEMOCRAT 

MISTER 

AND I- I- YOU ARE A FORME- YOU ARE A FORMER MAYOR OF SAN DIEGO 

WHEN WERE YOU MAYOR THERE 

AND WHAT WAS IT LIKE MAKING THAT MOVE FROM POLITICS TO R- RADIO TALK SHOW 

LET US GET TO THE PHONES FOR THE TWO OF YOU SHREVEPORT LOUISIANA YOU ARE FIRST GOOD MORNING 

MISTER HEDGECOCK 

THINK THE REAL PROBLEM IS THAT THESE KINDS OF REPUBLICAN ATTACKS I SEE AS CODE WORDS FOR DISCRIMINATION I AM A CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER AND I HAVE BEEN FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS IN PRIVATE PRACTICE AS A CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER DOING RACIAL DISCRIMINATION CASES AND SEX DISCRIMINATION CASES AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE KNOW WHAT THE RECORD WAS BEFORE WE HAD AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN THIS COUNTRY EVEN WITH AFFIRMATIVE ACTION MINORITIES AND WOMEN ONLY ENJOY A VERY SMALL SHARE AN UNEQUAL SHARE OF THE AMERICAN PIE BUT WITHOUT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AND PRE THE NI- THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT WE HAD AN EVEN SMALLER SHARE AND SO A- WE DO NOT WANT TO GO BACK TO THOSE DAYS AND BY THE WAY TO TALK ABOUT WELFARE IN THE SAME BREATH AS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MINORITIES I THINK IS FRANKLY STEREOTYPICAL BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE ON WELFARE ARE WHITE THEY ARE NOT AFRICAN AMERICAN 

WHEN IS 

A QUESTION TO YOU BY FAX THIS MORNING FROM LARRY SMITH IN NIXA MISSOURI HE ASKS YOU MISTER HEDGECOCK IT IS QUITE A LONG LONG IT IS SEVERAL PARAGRAPHS THAT HE WRITES HERE ABOUT TALK RADIO BUT LET ME GET TO THE QUESTION HE SAYS DO YOU SEE ANY INDICATION THAT CONSERVATIVE TALK SHOWS ARE LOSING POPULARITY AND IF SO DO YOU BELIEVE IT IS BECAUSE MOST LISTENERS CAN SEE LITTLE SUBSTANCE OR LESS CONSERVATIVISM AS AND A LOT OF INTOLERANCE FOR INTELLIGENT DISCUSSION BASICALLY HIS EARLIER POINTS WERE THAT CON- SO CALLED CONSERVATIVE TALK RADIO IS NOT CONSERVATIVE 

I THINK THAT THE RADICAL RIGHT WING HAS MAINLY TAKEN OVER THE AIRWAVES ON MANY MANY TALK SHOWS THROUGHOUT THIS NATION THERE IS NOT BALANCE ON THE AIRWAVES THERE ARE NOT AN EQUAL NUMBER OF PROGRESSIVES AND FRANKLY THE KIND OF PROPAGANDA THAT HAS BEEN SPEWING OUT OVER THE AIRWAVES FROM SOME OF THE RADICAL RIGHT WING EXTREMIST TALK SO- SHOW HOSTS I THINK HAS TURNED A LOT OF PEOPLE OFF AND MADE PEOPLE MORE SYMPATHETIC TO PRESIDENT CLINTON BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A RECORD HERE THAT PRESIDENT CLINTON IS RUNNING ON THERE IS A RECORD OF IMPROVING THE ECONOMY THERE IS A RECORD OF PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT AND PROTECTING MEDICARE AND A- AND THE PEOPLE KNOW IT AND THEY ARE GOING TO VOTE WITH THEIR THEY ARE GOING TO VOTE AT THE POLLS IN NOVEMBER AND SHOW A LOT OF THE RADICAL EXTREMISTS ON THE AIRWAVES WHAT THEY REALLY THINK ABOUT THIS PRESIDENT 

I HAVE NOT HEARD YOUR SHOW I THINK I HAVE BEEN ON YOUR SHOW A FEW TIMES AND YOU ARE NOT ONE OF THE PEOPLE I AM TALKING ABOUT BUT I AM ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF RADIO TALK SHOW HOSTS AND I AM FAMILIAR WITH MANY RADIO TALK SHOW HOSTS THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY AND I DO NOT SEE BALANCE ON THEIR 

SEE IT AS A QUESTION OF RATINGS I SEE IT AS A QUESTION OF THEY ARE NOT TRYING OUT A LOT OF PROGRESSIVE TALK SHOW HOSTS THAT THEY COULD TRY OUT BECAUSE MANY OF THE STATIONS ARE OWNED BY CONSERVATIVE OWNERS AND I DO NOT SEE THEM MEETING THEIR F. C. C. REQUIREMENTS IN MANY IT- TO- IN MANY INSTANCES TO MEET THE PUBLIC INTEREST 

WELL I DO NOT SEE THEM AS FAILING I SEE THEM AS NOT HAVING BEEN GIVEN AN ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITY 

WINDSOR VIRGINIA ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR VIEWERS RIGHT NOW GOOD MORNING 

GLAD 

BUT THANKS IF YOU THINK I AM ALL BRIGHT I WOULD APPRE- I 

WHY DO YOU SAY THAT CALLER 

GOOD MORNING I AM SO GLAD TO GET THROUGH 

ALBRIGHT OR WHATEVER YOUR NAME IS 

LET US GET THIS STRAIGHT NOW YOU ARE THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT SEPARATES THIS COUNTRY AND CAUSES HATRED IN THIS COUNTRY IS THIS WHAT YOUR THRIVING AGENDA IS 

BECAUSE SHE DOES SHE HAS JUST SET THERE AND SAID THE WOMEN HATE BOB DOLE THEY LOVE BILL CLINTON THE BLACKS HATE BOB DOLE THEY LOVE BILL CLINTON KNOCK IT OFF GIVE THIS COUNTRY A CHANCE TO GET TOGETHER DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS 

CHANCE TO GET TOGETHER 

NO BUT I THINK I WOULD FIND SOMETHING HERE 

IN THE LONG RUN PATIENTS ARE BEING READMITTED THE REHOSPITALIZATION STATISTICS A- HAVE INCREASED AND PATIENTS ARE GOING HOME MUCH SICKER AND THEN THEY ARE BEING READMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL SO IN ACTUALITY THEY ARE NOT SAVING MONEY 

GOOD MORNING 

I AM AFRAID TO TELL YOU THAT IT IS IT IS QUITE WIDESPREAD WHEN WE STARTED OUR SUPPORT ORGANIZATION FOR MILITARY WOMEN ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO OUR CO FOUNDERS THE MILITARY OFFICERS WHO ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR ORGANIZATION SAID TO US THAT THE FIRST PROBLEM WE NEEDED TO ATTACK WAS A PROBLEM THAT DEEPLY AFFECTS WOMEN IN THE ENLISTED RANKS PARTICULARLY THE YOUNGER ENLISTED MEMBERS AND THAT WAS THAT OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND THE KIND OF THING THAT WE ARE SEEING COME OUT HERE IN IN THIS MOST RECENT PROBLEM THAT THE ARMY HAS DIVULGED 

I AM ENCOURAGED I THINK THEY ARE HANDLING IT VERY WELL THAT IS THE RESULT OF REGULATIONS WHICH THEY PUT IN PLACE ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO HOLD PEOPLE WHO ENGAGE IN THIS KIND OF CONDUCT STRICTLY ACCOUNTABLE AND I CANNOT FAULT HOW GENERAL SHADLEY IS PERFORMING OUT THERE AT ABERDEEN I THINK HE IS DOING AN EXCELLENT JOB OF FOLLOWING THE SYSTEM THAT IS NOW IN PLACE WHICH REQUIRES PROMPT INVESTIGATIONS AND CHARGES WHERE APPROPRIATE 

NO AND OFTEN IT IS NOT DONE EVEN NOW WE STILL HAVE THE PROBLEM IN ALL OF THE SERVICES BUT THE ARMY HAS BEEN THE SERVICE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS THAT HAS SEEMED TO TAKE THE PROBLEM MOST SERIOUSLY AND AND HAD A PROGRAM TO ATTACK IT AND SO I AM NOT SURPRISED THAT ONCE IT WAS BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE APPROPRIATE OFFICIALS THAT THEY ARE HANDLING IT THIS WAY I I THINK HOWEVER MISTER EDWARDS WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO ALL OF THAT WHAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT NOW IS WHETHER THE ARMY IS WILLING TO GET AT THE BROADER AND DEEPER PROBLEM WHICH IS THE QUESTION OF A COMMAND ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE COMMAND THAT STILL LETS US THESE PROBLEMS EX- DEVELOP AND EXIST ON SUCH A WIDESPREAD BASIS 

WELL COMMAND- IN IN THE MILITARY SYSTEM COMMANDERS HAVE ENORMOUS POWER AND YOU DO NOT HAVE THIS KIND OF PROBLEM DEVELOP AND EXIST AND FLOURISH AS AS THIS HAS DONE APPARENTLY IN THE ARMY'S TRAINING COMMAND WITHOUT AN ATMOSPHERE THAT LETS PEOPLE WHO ARE INCLINED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS KIND OF CONDUCT BELIEVE THAT IT IS OKAY TO DO SO 

AND UN- UNFORTUNATELY IN THE MILITARY AS IN SOME PARTS OF CIVILIAN LIFE THESE ISSUES SEXUAL HARASSMENT HAD BEEN TREATED SORT OF / THEY ARE XR PUT IN A BOX AND TREATED AND LABELED AS WOMEN'S ISSUES AS OPPOSED TO THE REALLY IMPORTANT PROBLEMS THAT BEAR DIRECTLY ON IN THE MI- CASE OF THE MILITARY THE ABILITY OF OUR COUNTRY TO DEFEND ITSELF BECAUSE THEY DIRECTLY IMPACT WHAT THE MILITARY CALLS UNIT COHESION THAT IS THE WILL OF YOUNG PEOPLE TO PERFORM AS AN EFFICIENT MILITARY UNIT AND FIGHT TO DEFEND THEIR COUNTRY AND WHEN THE MILITARY REALLY BEGINS TREATING THE ISSUES ON THAT LEVEL AS OPPOSED TO A SO CALLED WOMEN'S ISSUE THEN WE WILL START TO SEE RE- SEE REAL PROGRESS 

LET ME TELL YOU THAT ARM- OUR OUR ARMY OFFICERS AND WE HAVE A LOT OF ARMY OFFICERS IN OUR ORGANIZATION TELL US THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT IS PARTICULARLY APPLICABLE TO THE YOUNG RECRUITS AND TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE AT THE LOWER LEVELS OF THE ENLISTED RANK FOR A VERY S- SIMPLE REASON ACTUALLY WE KNOW THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT TYPICALLY INVOLVES A MORE P- THE MORE POWERFUL P- INDIVIDUAL PREYING ON A MORE VULNERABLE INDIVIDUAL AND THERE ARE PROBABLY NO MORE NO ONE MORE VULNERABLE THAN A YOUNG RECRUIT OR A YOUNG ENLISTED PERSON AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF A MILITARY CAREER UNLIKE WOMEN IN CIVILIAN SOCIETY WHO CAN ALWAYS WALK AWAY FROM THIS KIND OF THING THAT IS IF YOU ARE HARASSED BY YOUR EMPLOYER YOU CAN QUIT YOUR JOB AND YOU CAN WALK RIGHT IN TO A VERY POWERFUL FEDERAL AGENCY THE E. E. O. C. AND HAVE YOUR CLAIM TAKEN SERIOUSLY THAT CANNOT HAPPEN IN THE MILITARY YOU ARE STUCK WHERE YOU ARE ASSIGNED AND YOU MUST DEAL WITH THAT PROBLEM ON A DAILY BASIS AND SO THE SUPERVISORS THAT THESE YOUNG WOMEN HAVE ENORMOUS POWER AND UNFORTUNATELY SOME SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THEM ABUSE IT 

THAT IS EXACTLY THAT IS REALLY WHAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS MANY OF US TEND TO SAY AND I THINK WE ARE RIGHT THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS REALLY MORE ABOUT POWER AND ABUSE OF POWER THAN IT IS ABOUT SEX

I. A. FINANCE THE CONTRAS 

DAVE GOOD PICTURES A LOT OF US HAD NOT SEEN THAT BEFORE 

A LOOK AT THE TOP STORIES THAT WE ARE FOLLOWING BILL CLINTON AND BOB DOLE ARE BOTH COURTING VOTERS IN THE MIDWEST TODAY THE PRESIDENT WILL SPEAK IN PARMA OHIO AND THEN MOVE ON TO DETROIT CLINTON HAS BEEN CAMPAIGNING FOR DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATES AND WARNING HIS AIDES AGAINST OVERCONFIDENCE DOLE ALSO HEADS FOR DETROIT AND AN ECONOMIC CONFERENCE OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS THEN HE BOARDS A BUS FOR A TWO DAY TOUR OF MICHIGAN CITIES 

A NEW YORK 

IN NICARAGUA FORMER SANDINISTA LEADER DANIEL ORTEGA'S COMEBACK BID WILL APPARENTLY FALL SHORT HE TRAILS FORMER MANAGUA MAYOR ARNALDO ALEMAN IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE ALEMAN IS A CONSERVATIVE AND NEEDS TO GET ABOVE FORTY FIVE PERCENT TO AVOID A RUNOFF AND HE SAYS HE WILL DO THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN NICARAGUA'S HISTORY THAT ONE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT HAS TRANSFERRED POWER TO ANOTHER 

IN NEW HAMPSHIRE YESTERDAY DOLE BLASTED THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN FOR ACCEPTING CONTRIBUTIONS FROM INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS INTERESTS HE SAID CAMPAIGN FINANCING LAWS MUST BE CHANGED TO PRESERVE VOTERS' CONFIDENCE IN THE SYSTEM 

CONTINUE BLASTING BILL CLINTON ON ETHICS CHARGES

A FIRE YESTERDAY IN THE LEMON HEIGHTS SECTION OF ORANGE COUNTY DESTROYED OR DAMAGED TWENTY NINE HOMES BEFORE IT WAS CONTAINED THE WILDFIRES ARE BEING FED BY TINDER DRY BRUSH AND THEN FANNED BY THOSE SANTA ANA WINDS 

MORIAL 

ALTHOUGH NEW ORLEANS STILL LEADS THE NATION'S LARGEST CITIES IN HOMICIDE THE MURDER RATE HERE HAS 

THE CITY'S CRIME PROBLEM IS MOST EVIDENT IN THE FIFTH DISTRICT KNOWN AS ONE OF THE MOST CRIME RIDDEN NEIGHBORHOODS IN AMERICA IT ENCOMPASSES SOME OF NEW ORLEANS' POOREST AND MOST DENSELY POPULATED NEIGHBORHOODS WOODEN HOUSES ARE PACKED TIGHTLY ALONG THE NARROW STREETS TWO OF THE CITY'S MOST VIOLENT HOUSING PROJECTS FLORIDA AND DESIRE ARE AT ONE END OF THE DISTRICT DRUG USE IS COMMON CAPTAIN DONALD CURALL IS THE DISTRICT'S POLICE COMMANDER 

FIFTH DISTRICT DETECTIVES MEET DAILY TO COMPARE NOTES ON RECENT 

THE FIFTH DISTRICT GETS AN AVERAGE OF TEN THOUSAND CALLS A MONTH AND UNTIL RECENTLY HAD A BACKLOG OF CALLS WHICH OFFICERS DID NOT RESPOND TO FOR MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS BUT RESPONSE TIME WAS NOT THE ONLY PROBLEM HERE POLICE IN THIS DISTRICT HAD A BAD REPUTATION AND FOR GOOD REASON TWO YEARS AGO FEDERAL AGENTS DISCOVERED A DRUG TRAFFICKING RING WITHIN THE FORCE AND ONE OF THE RING'S LEADERS OFFICER LEN DAVIS WAS CONVICTED OF ORDERING THE MURDER OF A WOMAN WHO FILED A BRUTALITY COMPLAINT AGAINST HIM CITIZENS WERE AFRAID OF 

THIS MAN WHO WOULD NOT GIVE HIS NAME SAYS PEOPLE IN THE FIFTH DISTRICT ARE AFRAID IF THEY CALL POLICE AND REPORT A CRIME THE CRIMINALS WILL FIND OUT 

HIS MOTHER PEEPING OUT HER BACK DOOR IS BEGGING HER GROWN CHILDREN NOT TO PUBLICLY CRITICIZE POLICE HER FEAR ILLUSTRATES THE BROKEN TRUST BETWEEN OFFICER AND CITIZEN ACCORDING TO HER DAUGHTER IN LAW 

IT IS LIKE THEY SEE STUFF GOING ON AND THEY WILL NOT THEY WILL NOT CALL 'CAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID AND ESPECIALLY THE ELDERLY PEOPLE SEE THEY IN THEIR HOUSE BY THEIRSELF AND THEY ARE AFRAID 

SHE WILL NOT SEE AND BECAUSE SHE KNOW SHE CALLED THEM THEY GOING TO HAVE HER SHE GOING TO BE HARASSED BY WHOEVER DOING THE CRIME 

SO EVEN THOUGH THINGS ARE BETTER ON PAPER IN THE FIFTH DISTRICT THERE IS STILL A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE PEOPLE HERE FEEL SAFE 

MEANWHILE IN THE FRENCH QUARTER WHERE HORSE DRAWN CARRIAGES CARRY TOURISTS THROUGH THE HISTORIC STREETS BUSINESS LEADERS ARE CONCERNED FEAR OF CRIME IS JEOPARDIZING THE CITY'S THREE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR TOURIST TRADE WHILE DISTRUST OF POLICE IS NOT THE PROBLEM HERE A GROWING NUMBER OF ARMED ROBBERIES IS CAUSING CONCERN EVEN THOUGH FRENCH QUARTER RESIDENT AMY MCCONNEL FRANKLIN HAS NEVER BEEN THE VICTIM OF A VIOLENT CRIME SAFETY IS STILL A CONCERN FOR HER FAMILY 

YEAH I HAVE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT THE CRIME SINCE I MOVED TO NEW ORLEANS WHICH HAS BEEN THIRTEEN YEARS AGO AND I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE CRIME ALL OVER THE CITY AND PARTICULARLY IN THE FRENCH QUARTER BECAUSE WE LIVE HERE AND I HAVE THREE KIDS AND I DO NOT WANT THEM TO BE AFRAI- AFRAID OF BEING MUGGED OR JUMPED OR TO BE WORRIED ABOUT CROSSING THE STREET WHEN THEY SEE SOMEONE WALKING DOWN THE STREET AND THAT SORT OF THING 

MORE POLICE HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED TO THE FRENCH QUARTER AND RESIDENTS SAY THAT IS A START TOWARD MAKING THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD SAFER POLICE AND CITY LEADERS AGREE CONTINUING THE DOWNWARD CRIME TREND IS CRUCIAL TO THE CITY'S VIABILITY AND A MORE PROMINENT POLICE PRESENCE IS PART OF THAT 

IT WAS HERE AT THE RIVER'S EDGE ON SOME LAND BELONGING TO THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS WHERE THE SKULL AND BONES WERE FOUND LAST SUMMER IN KENNEWICK WASHINGTON THE LOCAL COUNTRY CORONER WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO EXAMINE THE REMAINS AND HE DECIDED TO CALL IN ANTHROPOLOGIST JIM CHATTERS AT FIRST GLANCE CHATTERS SAYS THE SKULL APPEARED TO HAVE CAUCASOID LIKE FEATURES AND HE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE THE REMAINS OF A MOUNTAIN MAN BUT FURTHER EXAMINATION REVEALED A STONE 

WHITE BALLOONS PEOPLE WEARING WHITE HATS CLUTCHING WHITE FLOWERS THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE MORE THAN THREE PERCENT OF THE ENTIRE POPULATION RALLIED TO THE CALL TO MARCH MANY BROUGHT THEIR CHILDREN WITH THEM TO SUPPORT THE PARENTS OF CHILDREN WHO FELL VICTIM TO A GANG OF PEDOPHILES TWO GIRLS WERE FOUND STARVED TO DEATH AFTER THEY HAD BEEN MISSING FOR MORE THAN A YEAR TWO TEENAGERS WERE FOUND 

THE FAMILIES OF CHILDREN STILL MISSING AND A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL WHOSE RESCUE FROM THE CLUTCHES OF THE GANG LED TO THEIR ARREST ON CHARGES OF 

THE POLICE HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF MISHANDLING THE SEARCH FOR MISSING CHILDREN ALLEGATIONS OF A COVER UP BY POLICE AND THE JUDICIARY ACCOMPANIED THE ARREST OF THE PEDOPHILE GANG THIS MARCH FOLLOWS A WEEK OF WILDCAT STRIKES AND DEMONSTRATIONS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY SPARKED OFF BY THE DISMISSAL OF A JUDGE

GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME TO C. N. N. MORNING NEWS GOOD TO SEE 

WEAR SOMETHING WHITE SAID THE ORGANIZERS A SYMBOL OF THE INNOCENCE AND PURITY OF CHILDHOOD AND THE BOULEVARDS OF BRUSSELS BECAME A SEA OF WHITE 

MURDERED ALONGSIDE THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS 

KIDNAP RAPE AND MURDER 

IT IS CLEAR THIS IS NOT ONLY IN SUPPORT OF THE VICTIMS OF CHILD ABUSE AND THEIR PARENTS THERE IS GROWING DISSATISFACTION IN THE COUNTRY AT WHAT IS PERCEIVED AS WIDESPREAD CORRUPTION AMONG THE AUTHORITIES ESPECIALLY POLICE AND POLITICIANS THIS IS HOW BELGIUM IS VOTING FOR CHANGE 

WHO BECAME A NATIONAL HERO WHEN HIS INVESTIGATIONS PUT THE PEDOPHILE GANG BEHIND BARS 

THIS WOMAN SAYS THERE IS ONE LAW FOR THE RICH AND ONE FOR THE POOR 

WE HAVE NOT GOT MUCH CONFIDENCE LEFT WE ARE ASKING FOR ONE THING AND THAT IS THE TRUTH 

THEY HAVE TO TAKE THE PUBLIC INTO ACCOUNT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A DEMOCRACY IN BELGIUM AND IF THEY DO NOT LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE THEN IT IS NOT A DEMOCRACY 

BELGIUM HAS NOT SEEN THIS MANY PEOPLE ON THE STREETS SINCE THE END OF WORLD WAR TWO WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS LIBERATED FROM OCCUPATION AND BY THE TIME THESE MARCHERS GOT HOME THEY LEARNED THEIR PROTEST HAD GAINED SOME RESULT THE BELGIAN PRIME MINISTER PROMISED TO MAKE THE JUDICIARY INDEPENDENT AND DO AWAY WITH THE POLITICAL NOMINATION OF JUDGES ONE OF THE CAUSES OF THE COUNTRY'S

ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT MINUTES O- THE FINAL DEBATE OF THE GENERAL ELECTION OF NINETEEN NINETY SIX IN NINETEEN DAYS THE MOST IMPORTANT DECISION OUR CITIZENS MAKE EVERY FOUR YEARS CHOOSING THE LEADER OF THIS REPUBLIC WHEN THE COMMISSION ON PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES WAS FORMED IT WAS OUR BELIEF THAT IN THE TOTAL CLIMATE OF A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN DEBATES EVERY FOUR YEARS BEFORE BETWEEN THE ULTIMATE ACTUAL FINALISTS CONTENDING FOR PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES SHOULD TAKE PLACE THAT BELIEF WAS REAFFIRMED BY THE VOTERS WHO LEFT THE EXIT POLLS IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO AND SAID THE DEBATES WERE THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT VOTER EDUCATION PROJECT THAT TAKES PLACE IN OUR CAMPAIGN ENVIRONMENT 

THIS IS WELL THE TH- THIRD DEBATE OF NINETEEN NINETY SIX HAVING HAD ONE IN HARTFORD BETWEEN THE TWO MEN YOU ARE GOING TO BE SEEING IN A FEW MOMENTS AND ONE IN SAINT PETERSBURG FLORIDA A FEW DAYS AGO BETWEEN THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES IT IS ACTUALLY THE TENTH DEBATE THAT THE COMMISSION ON PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES HAS PRODUCED IN THE LAST THREE ELECTION CYCLES AND WHILE IT IS THE END FOR NINETEEN NINETY SIX WE FEEL A A A GREAT DEBT OF GRATITUDE TO A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO MADE IT HAPPEN SORT OF IN HOUSE IF YOU WILL YOU ARE GOING TO HEAR IN A FEW MOMENTS FROM THE PEOPLE REPRESENTING THIS UNIVERSITY AND THIS COMMUNITY BUT THERE IS SOME WHO WITHOUT THEIR ASSISTANCE AND HELP AND SUPPORT THOSE TEN DEBATES WOULD NEVER HAVE TAKEN PLACE THE COMMISSION ON PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES HAS THREE HONORARY CHAIRMEN TWO COULD NOT BE WITH US TONIGHT FORMER PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN AND FORMER PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER BUT AS YOU ARE GOING TO SEE IN A FEW MOMENTS ONE COULD BE FORMER UNITED STATES PRESIDENT GERALD FORD WILL BE SEATED RIGHT DOWN HERE IN A FEW MOMENTS JOINING US FOR THE EVENING 

I AM JIM LEHRER OF THE NEWS HOUR ON P. B. S. WELCOME TO THIS SECOND NINETEEN NINETY SIX PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE BETWEEN SENATOR BOB DOLE THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE AND PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE IT IS SPONSORED BY THE COMMISSION ON PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES WE WILL FOLLOW A TOWN HALL TYPE FORMAT TONIGHT THE QUESTIONS OVER THE NEXT NINETY MINUTES WILL COME FROM ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN CITIZENS OF THE GREATER SAN DIEGO AREA THEY WERE CHOSEN IN THE PAST WEEK BY THE GALLUP ORGANIZATION TO REPRESENT A ROUGH CROSS SECTION OF VOTERS AS TO POLITICAL VIEWS AGE GENDER AND OTHER FACTORS EACH SAID HE OR SHE IS UNDECIDED ABOUT THIS PRESIDENTIAL RACE THEY WERE TOLD TO COME TONIGHT WITH QUESTIONS NOBODY FROM THE DEBATE COMMISSION OR THE TWO CAMPAIGNS HAS ANY IDEA WHAT THOSE QUESTIONS ARE NEITHER DO I WE WILL ALL BE HEARING THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME AT THE SAME TIME I MET WITH THIS GROUP THREE HOURS AGO AND WE SPOKE ONLY ABOUT HOW IT WAS GOING TO WORK TONIGHT 

ONE THING I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS I AGREE WITH WHAT SENATOR DOLE SAID IT IS A REMARKABLE THING IN A COUNTRY LIKE OURS THAT A MAN WHO GREW UP IN RUSSELL KANSAS AND ONE WHO WAS BORN TO A WIDOWED MOTHER IN HOPE ARKANSAS COULD WIND UP RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT COULD HAVE A CHANCE TO SERVE AS PRESIDENT THE FIRST THING I WANT TO SAY IS THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE CHANCE TO BE PRESIDENT THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT VISIONS ABOUT HOW WE SHOULD GO INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WOULD WE BE BETTER OFF AS I BELIEVE WORKING TOGETHER TO GIVE EACH OTHER THE TOOLS WE NEED TO MAKE THE MOST OF OUR GOD GIVEN POTENTIAL OR ARE WE BETTER OFF SAYING YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN WOULD WE BE BETTER OFF BUILDING THAT BRIDGE TO THE FUTURE TOGETHER SO WE CAN ALL WALK ACROSS IT OR SAYING YOU CAN GET ACROSS YOURSELF IF YOU DO NOT AGREE LEAVE THI- THIS ROOM WITH ANYTHING ELSE TONIGHT AND IF THE PEOPLE WATCHING US DO NOT LEAVE WITH ANYTHING ELSE I HOPE YOU WILL LEAVE WITH THIS THIS IS A REAL IMPORTANT ELECTION THE WORLD IS CHANGING DRAMATICALLY IN HOW WE WORK AND HOW WE LIVE HOW WE RELATE TO EACH OTHER 

THIS IS WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT IT IS NOT ABOUT ME IT IS NOT ABOUT PRESIDENT CLINTON IT IS ABOUT THE PROCESS IT IS ABOUT SELECTING A PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SO WE HAVE OUR DIFFERENCES WE SHOULD HAVE OUR DIFFERENCES MENTION OTHER PARTIES THEY HAVE THEIR DIFFERENCES IF WE ALL AGREED IT WOULD BE A PRETTY DULL PLACE WE SHOULD HAVE MORE DEBATES MAYBE WE WILL HAVE ANOTHER DEBATE ON ON THE ECONOMY BUT I WOULD JUST SAY THIS THIS IS THE HIGHEST HONOR THAT I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE TO THINK THAT SOMEBODY FROM RUSSELL KANSAS SOMEBODY WHO GREW UP LIVING IN A BASEMENT APARTMENT SOMEBODY WHOSE PARENTS DID NOT FINISH HIGH SCHOOL SOMEBODY WHO SPENT ABOUT THIRTY NINE MONTHS IN HOSPITALS AFTER WORLD WAR TWO SOMEBODY WHO USES A BUTTON HOOK EVERY DAY TO GET DRESSED SOMEBODY WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT THE REAL AMERICANS OUT THERE WITH REAL PROBLEMS WHETHER SOCCER MOMS OR THE SING- SINGLE PARENTS OR FAMILIES WORKING OR SENIORS OR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WHOEVER IT MAY BE 

AS ITS FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT WE ARE A LEADER IN HELPING THE WORLD TO UNDERSTAND THAT FOREIGNERS AND IN FACT AMERICANS ARE FOREIGNERS WHEN WE LIVE IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND WORK THERE ARE NOT A THREAT BUT ACTUALLY FURTHER THE SOCIAL AND FABRIC OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL OBJECTIVES OF ALL COUNTRIES IN THIS REGARD THE INTERNATIONAL CENTER BELIEVES THAT WE WILL BENEFIT FROM LESS REGULATION AND LEGAL DISCRIMINATION IN THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETPLACES AS GREATER COMPETITION WILL LOWER CONSUMER PRICES INCREASE PURCHASING POWER AND CHALLENGE AMERICANS AND OTHERS TO STRIVE TO BE BETTER INDEED AMERICANS ARE A COMPETITIVE PEOPLE AND AS LONG AS OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT PROVIDES EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR EACH CITIZEN TO REACH HIS MAXIMUM POTENTIAL WE WILL ALWAYS EXCEL AND PROSPER AS FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT SAID WHEN DISCUSSING AN EQUALLY SIGNIFICANT TASK WE HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR BUT FEAR ITSELF 

AT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE ARE PRAYING TO GET SOME KIND OF RELIEF FROM THIS OPPRESSIVE OVERWHELMING EXPENSIVE GOVERNMENT BOB DOLE EXPLAINED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO CANDIDATES HE SAID THAT BILL CLINTON WANTED GOVERNMENT TO IN- INCREASE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS BY TWENTY PERCENT BUT BOB DOLE WANTED GOVERNMENT TO INCREASE BY ONLY FOURTEEN PERCENT THIS IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM THIS IS THE TRIVIAL DIFFERENCE THAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO CHOOSE FROM THIS YEAR AT A TIME WHEN WE WANT SMALLER GOVERNMENT THEY DEFINE SMALLER GOVERNMENT AS BEING I DO NOT WANT IT TO GROW AS FAST AS MY OPPONENT DOES AT A TIME WHEN WE WANT SMALLER GOVERNMENT THEY DEFINE SMALLER GOVERNMENT AS GETTING RID OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND SPREADING THE FUNCTIONS OVER THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS OF GOVERNMENT AT A TIME WHEN WE WANT SMALLER GOVERNMENT BILL CLINTON MAKES UP STORIES ABOUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BEING THE SMALLEST THE SMALLEST IT HAS BEEN SINCE JOHN F. KENNEDY'S DAY WHEN IN FACT EVERY ONE OF US KNOWS THAT EVERY YEAR GOVERNMENT GETS BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND BIGGER AND IT NEVER STOPS WHEN IS IT GOING TO STOP 

SO IT IS IN THIS LEADERSHIP VACUUM THAT AMERICA'S FASTEST GROWING GRASSROOTS PARTY HAS EMERGED THE NATURAL LAW PARTY DEDICATED TO PROVEN COST EFFECTIVE COMMONSENSE SOLUTIONS TO AMERICA'S PROBLEMS I AM A RESEARCH SCIENTIST AND HAVE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH LEADING SCIENTISTS EDUCATORS BUSINESSMEN FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO SCOUR AMERICA FOR THE MOST EFFECTIVE FIELD TESTED COMMONSENSE SOLUTIONS TO AMERICA'S PROBLEMS WE HAVE PUT THESE SOLUTIONS TOGETHER INTO A SINGLE COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT A FIFTY POINT ACTION PLAN TO REVITALIZE AMERICA AN ALL OUT ASSAULT ON AMERICA'S PROBLEMS AND THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE PLATFORM OF SOLUTIONS EVER PUT FORWARD BY A POLITICAL PARTY THESE SOLUTIONS TEND TO BE FORWARD LOOKING PREVENTION ORIENTED DESIGNED TO BRING OUR NATIONAL POLICIES INTO GREATER HARMONY WITH NATURAL LAW SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE PROVEN PREVENTIVE SERVICES IN OUR PRIVATE AND PUBLIC HEALTH S- HEALTHCARE SECTOR SINCE ACCORDING TO THE JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION SEVENTY PERCENT OF OUR DISEASE IS SELF INFLICTED AND PREVENTABLE 

MY THANKS TO THE SPONSORS AND THE PANELISTS MY CONGRATULATIONS TO MY FELLOW CANDIDATES THE WAR FOR AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE WAS FOUGHT OVER THE PRINCIPLE THAT A FREE PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE ITS OWN LAWS AND DETER- DETERMINE THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY WOULD BE TAXED AND HOW THEIR RESOURCES WOULD BE COMMITTED THE FRAMERS OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AFTER ACKNOWLEDGING THAT GOD IS OUR CREATOR AND THAT IT IS HE WHO ENDOWED US WITH CERTAIN INALIENABLE RIGHTS TO LIFE LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS WENT ON TO SAY THAT GOVERNMENT DERIVES ITS JUST POWERS FROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED IT WAS FOR THAT REASON THAT RIGHT AFTER THE PREAMBLE TO THE CONSTITUTION IN ARTICLE ONE SECTION ONE THEY STIPULATED THAT ALL LEGISLATIVE POWERS SHALL BE VESTED IN A CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES 

RALPH NADER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SUCH THINGS AS THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT THE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY THE CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION THE SAFE WATER DRINKING ACT AND UH MEAT AND POULTRY INSPECTION LAWS THE MAN HAS A BETTER LEGISLATIVE RECORD THAN MANY CURRENT OFFICIALS IN OUR GOVERNMENT SPEAKING OF SAID GOVERNMENT MISTER NADER HAS SAID THE GOVERNMENT SELLS THE TRUST OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FOR A BILLION DOLLARS OF CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS EACH YEAR A BILLION DOLLARS TAKES CONTROL OF THE U. S. GOVERNMENT THERE IS NO HIGHER RETURN ON INVESTMENT ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD SHE SAYS WE NEED MORE COMPETITION MORE PARTIES IN THE FRAY AND MORE ROBUST DEBATE WE NEED TO GENERATE FRESH POLITICAL ENERGY HALF OF THE PEOPLE STAY HOME FEELING APATHETIC AND POWERLESS 

MORNING 

YES IT DOES THERE ARE EARLY VOTING IN A NUMBER OF STATES THIS YEAR AND IT GIVES A CHANCE FOR FOR PEOPLE TO CAST THEIR BALLOT EVEN BEFORE ELECTION DAY AND COLORADO AND A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES ARIZONA SEVERAL OTHERS AROUND THE COUNTRY HAVE STARTED DOING THIS IT IS A A NEW TREND IN POLITICS I THINK THE MERITS THERE- THERE IS SORT OF A DEBATE ON ON WHETHER IT IS A GOOD THING OR NOT I KNOW ONE THING IT MAKES POLLING VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT IS SORT OF A A MOVING TARGET 

ABSOLUTELY THEY ARE IN THE STATE AND I GUESS THEY FEEL THEY DO NOT NEED TO SEE THE FINAL THREE WEEKS OF THE CAMPAIGN THEY HAVE MADE UP THEIR MINDS AND THEY CAN GO AND AND CAST A BALLOT 

IT IS FAIRLY NEW IN SOME STATES LIKE COLORADO ONE INTERESTING THING AS YOU WERE RATTLING OFF SOME OF THOSE NAMES SOME OF THOSE ARE ARE VIEWED AS REALLY KEY SWING STATES IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE AND YOU KIND OF WONDER WHETHER VOTERS HAVE MADE UP THEIR MINDS YET OR WH- OR WHETHER THEY MIGHT WANT TO WAIT A LITTLE BIT LONGER I KNOW BOTH OF THE CANDIDATES WILL PROBABLY BE MAKING FINAL SWINGS THROUGH THERE AND AND I DO NOT KNOW IF THAT INFLUENCES PEOPLE OR NOT BUT IT IS INTERESTING THAT A NUMBER OF THOSE ARE VERY MUCH IN PLAY 

WELL THERE IS ALWAYS A LAG TIME BETWEEN ECONOMIC INDICATORS AND AND MOOD WE SAW THAT AT THE END OF PRESIDENT BUSH'S ADMINISTRATION WHEN THE ECONOMY WAS ACTUALLY STARTING TO IMPROVE BUT WHEN IT CAME TO ELECTION DAY PEOPLE WERE STILL IN A FUNK NOW AFTER ALL OF THE CORPORATE DOWNSIZING AND AND ALL OF THE DEBATE OVER NAFTA I GUESS PEOPLE ARE WAKING UP AND REALIZING THAT THEY ARE STILL ALIVE AND THEY ARE FEELING A LITTLE BETTER IT- IT IS ALSO LINKED TO NON ECONOMIC THINGS LIKE THE COVERAGE OF THE OLYMPICS I GUESS IT WAS THAT MOVIE INDEPENDENCE DAY SOME PEOPLE ARE ATTRIBUTING IT TO THAT NICE YOU KNOW SHOT OF 

I- IT IS CERTAINLY INTERESTING TO THINK THAT THAT SOMETHING LIKE THE MACARENA MIGHT INFLUENCE THE WAY PEOPLE VOTE BUT A- I I YOU KNOW YOU TAKE NOTE OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND THEN YOU TAKE NOTE OF A SERIES OF ARTICLES BASED ON WASHINGTON POST POLLING EARLIER THIS WEEK THAT SHOWED A TREMENDOUS DISCONNECT BETWEEN ECONOMIC REALITY AND WHAT PEOPLE THINK SOME PEOPLE ARE STILL UNDER THE IMPRESSION THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS AS HIGH AS TWENTY PERCENT WHEN IT IS MORE LIKE FIVE AND I- IT IT REALLY SUGGESTS THAT THAT IN SOME WAYS THERE IT IS MORE OF A MOOD INFLUENCE THING THAN THAN BASED IN THE NUMBERS 

WELL SURE IT DOES WHENEVER A MOOD IS GOOD HE CAN TAKE CREDIT FOR THAT AND WE SOMETIMES US CYNICAL REPORTERS HERE IN THE PRESS CORPS JOKE THAT WHEN HE IS IN CAMPAIGN MODE HE WILL TAKE CREDIT FOR THE SUN RISING BUT IT IS ONE OF THESE SITUATIONS WHERE ANY SORT OF POSITIVE FEELING BENEFITS THE INCUMBENT AND HE CAN TAKE CREDIT FOR IT 

THIS IS THE THE LATEST QUESTION TO SURFACE THAT GETS TO THE ISSUE OF PUBLIC TRUST IT IS SOMETHING THAT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN PUSHING REAL HARD THE LAST FEW DAYS AND IT IT DOES IN THEIR VIEW PUT THIS QUESTION OF OF WHETHER THE WHITE HOUSE THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT AND SUCH ARE FOR SALE THIS IS A WEALTHY INDONESIAN FAMILY THAT THAT HAS A A GREAT INFLUENCE ON THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMY AND THEY HAVE FUNNELED A LOT OF MONEY INTO DEMOCRATIC COFFERS AND THE QUESTION IS WHETHER TH- THE THEY HAVE ARRANGED FOR PREFERENTIAL TRADE AND DIPLOMATIC TREATMENT FOR FOR A COUNTRY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION ITSELF WAS INVESTIGATING FOR QUESTIONABLE LABOR PRACTICES 

WHE- WHETHER THERE IS THIS STICKS OR NOT OR WHETHER I- IT IS IT IS A LITTLE BIT TOO INVOLVED TO TO REALLY BECOME A BIG CAMPAIGN ISSUE I DO NOT KNOW BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THAT BOB DOLE WILL BE BRINGING THAT UP TONIGHT DURING THE FINAL DEBATE AND THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION SAYS ALL OF THIS WAS ON THE UP AND UP THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION HAS REVIEWED THIS AND AND THEY SEEM TO THINK THAT THAT THAT THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH IT 

FEEDS INTO THE WHOLE PUBLIC PERCEPTION THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM MONEY AND POLITICS IS AN ENORMOUS TOPIC OF DISCUSSION HERE PEOPLE TALK ABOUT IT A LOT BUT THERE HAVE NOT BEEN A LOT OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGES COMING OUT OF CONGRESS BOTH PARTIES HAVE BENEFITED A GREAT DEAL FROM BIG CORPORATE MONEY COMING IN AND AND FAVORS HAVE GONE OUT WE SAW THE REPUBLICANS THERE IS A PIECE IN THE SAME L. A. TIMES ABOUT HOW BOB DOLE HAS GIVEN VARIOUS TAX AND BUSINESS BREAKS TO THE GALLO WINE FAMILY AMONG HIS BIGGEST POLITICAL PATRONS 

WELL I THINK DOLE IS IN A A TOUGH SITUATION THERE HAS B- THIS IN- I- IN- VERY UNUSUAL PUBLIC AGONIZING OVER HOW TOUGH HE SHOULD BE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL HE IS PERCEIVED I THINK SOMETIMES UNJUSTLY AS BEING EXCESSIVELY NEGATIVE MEAN BITTER DARK AND AND WITH THAT COMES THE RISK IF HE IS COMING OFF TOO STRONG ATTACKING CLINTON OF REINFORCING THAT AT THE SAME TIME MANY PEOPLE WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY FEEL THAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT TOUGHER IN THE FIRST DEBATE ON ON CLINTON'S ETHICAL PROBLEMS ON VARIOUS PROBLEMS AND SCANDALS THAT HAVE SURROUNDED THE ADMINISTRATION THEY FEEL THAT HE BLEW A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY SO TONIGHT IN THE FINAL DEBATE HE HAS GOT TO WALK A VERY VERY FINE LINE NOT TO GO TOO NEGATIVE BUT AT THE SAME TIME RAISE THE FINAL QUESTION FOR THE FINAL TIME ABOUT PUBLIC TRUST BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY HIS LAST TIME IN THE NATIONAL SPOTLIGHT IN IN THE FINAL THREE WEEKS 

GOOD MORNING CONNIE 

WELL UP AND DOWN THE LINE OF COURSE CALIFORNIAN CALIFORNIAN REPUBLICANS ARE FEARFUL THAT DOLE WILL PULL A BUSH IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO THEN PRESIDENT BUSH G- ABANDONED CALIFORNIA AND A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT HOUSE SEATS FOR EXAMPLE WENT TO DEMOCRATS WHO IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR WERE TURNED OUT AND REPUBLICANS REPLACED THEM WHEN THERE WAS A MUCH STRONGER REPUBLICAN EFFORT BUT I THINK IT AS OPPOSED TO WHAT GLORIA SAID I THINK THAT THAT SENATOR DOLE DOES HAVE A STRONG CHANCE TO WIN IN CALIFORNIA AND THE REASON I SAY THAT IS THE FIELD POLL WHICH JUST CAME OUT A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO INDICATES THAT THE TWENTY ONE POINT LEAD OF THREE OR FOUR WEEKS AGO THAT PRESIDENT CLINTON HAD HAS BEEN SHAVED TO ABOUT TEN POINTS AND IF YOU ARE PETE WILSON HE GOT RE ELECTED IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR AGAINST KATHLEEN BROWN FOR GOVERNOR WITH A SIMILAR KATHLEEN BROWN LEAD EVAPORATING IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS OF THE CAMPAIGN 

WELL CONNIE THAT IS THE KEY POINT HERE PROPOSITION TWO OH NINE WHICH BANS GENDER PREFERENCES GENDER AND RACE PREFERENCES AND QUOTAS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IS LEADING IN THE CURRENT FIELD POLL TWO TO ONE AND ACROSS THE BOARD YOU FIND AFRICAN AMERICAN SUPPORT HISPANIC SUPPORT WHITE MI- SUPPORT WOMEN SUPPORT THE TRUTH IS THAT TWO OH NINE IS THE SURFBOARD THAT BOB DOLE COULD USE TO USE A CALIFORNIA METAPHOR 

HERE IN CALIFORNIA 

I THINK HE WILL AND I THINK YOU ARE GOING TO SEE THAT IN THIS DEBATE COMING UP TODAY YOU KNOW IT IS THAT CONNIE PROP TWO OH NINE AND THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ISSUE COURSE WE IN SAN DIEGO HERE ARE AT GROUND ZERO OF THE INVASION OF THE UNITED STATES EVERY DAY BY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE BREAKING INTO THIS COUNTRY AND IT IS A VERY VERY SEVERE PROBLEM HERE AND I THINK THOSE TWO ISSUES ARE THE BREAKING ISSUES THAT COULD GIVE BOB DOLE CALIFORNIA IF HE WERE TO TAKE THEM ON STRONGLY AND SQUARELY IN THE DEBATE TONIGHT 

CONNIE ON MY PROGRAM WE HAVE MORE OF A COMMUNITY FORUM AND I HAVE NOT TAKEN A POSITION ON CANDIDATES ALTHOUGH WE TEND TO BE A CONSERVATIVE RATHER THAN A PARTY AFFILIATED TYPE TALK SHOW 

YES I AM 

IN THE MID NINETEEN EIGHTIES 

WELL IT WAS WONDERFUL BECAUSE BECAUSE ON THE RADIO AND IN THE MEDIA YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO FORM PUBLIC OPINION RATHER THAN BEING A CAPTIVE OF THIS POLITICAL SYSTEM WHICH AS YOUR PREVIOUS GUEST POINTED OUT IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY MANIPULATED BY THE SPECIAL INTERESTS AND M- AND THE MONEY INTERESTS WHO HAVE CAPTIVATED IT 

WELL I THINK THEY ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT IT AND THEY ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT YOU RAISE I I HEAR JACK KEMP ALL THE TIME TALKING ABOUT WHAT IS REALLY GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR MINORITIES IN THIS COMU- IN THIS COUNTRY AND THAT IS NOT SET ASIDES AND QUOTAS AND PREFERENCES WHAT IT IS IS OPPORTUNITY AND A PIECE OF THE ECONOMIC PIE YOU ARE GOING TO GET AHEAD AS A MINORITY OR ANY OTHER KIND OF AMERICAN WHEN YOU HAVE A CHANCE AT OWNERSHIP WHEN YOU HAVE A CHANCE AT ENTREPRENEURSHIP WHEN YOU HAVE A CHANCE AT QUALITY EDUCATION NOW ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE IN DOUBT AFTER FORTY YEARS OF DEMOCRATIC RULE IN CONGRESS BECAUSE YOU HAVE GOT QUOTAS AND SET ASIDES AND RIGIDITIES IN THIS SYSTEM THAT KEEP YOU ON WELFARE AND AWAY FROM REAL OWNERSHIP AND THAT IS A REAL PROBLEM IN THIS 

WEL- TO TALK ABOUT WELFARE CONNIE FRANKLY IS TO TALK REALISTICALLY IN EVERY COMMUNITY ABOUT THE KINDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TRAPPED THERE AND THAT IS WHY PRESIDENT CLINTON HAS SIGNED THE WELFARE REFORM BILL BECAUSE WE DRASTICALLY NEED TO AMEND THAT SYSTEM TO GIVE PEOPLE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE PEOPLE JOBS AND NOT TO CON- TO CONTINUE THEM IN A IN A DEPENDENT CLASS 

WELL MY TALK SHOW IS CONSERVATIVE WE ARE CONSTITUTIONALIST AND WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE DECAY OF AMERICA ON THE MORAL AND ECONOMIC ISSUES AND WE TALK ABOUT THEM ALL THE TIME THANKFULLY MY RATINGS ARE GOING UP SO I DO NOT KNOW WHICH ONE HE IS TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF PROBLEMS WITH THE TALK SHOWS THE CONSERVATIVE TALK SHOWS BUT I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS THE ANNENBERG SCHOOL RECENTLY CAME OUT WITH A SURVEY OF WHO DOES LISTEN TO TALK RADIO AND PARTICULARLY CONSERVATIVE TALK RADIO AND THEY FOUND OUT THAT IT IS THE HIGHER EDUCATED PEOPLE WHO REALLY ARE CONCERNED WHO DO VOTE WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE IN SIN- AND I HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED WITH ONLY SPEAKING TO THE SHUT INS AND THE UNEMPLOYEDS AND THE AND THE AND SOME KIND OF KOOK FRINGE THAT IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL AND FRANKLY WHEN PRESIDENT CLINTON TRIED TO CHARACTERIZE TALK SHOW HOSTS AS THE CAUSE OF THE OKLAHOMA BOMBING I THINK WE REACHED A SCANDALOUS LOW IN SMEAR CAMPAIGNS IN THIS COU- IN THIS COUNTRY THAT IS NOT BORNE OUT BY THE ACTUAL SURVEYS AND AND AGAIN THANKFULLY MY RATINGS CONNIE ARE GOING UP 

WELL I HOPE I HOPE GLORIA YOU ARE NOT YOU ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT ME 

INTERESTING THING ABOUT BALANCE IN THIS G- IN THIS SITUATION IS THAT WE ARE IN THE FREE MARKET IN THE RADIO BUSINESS AND PEOPLE CAN EITHER LISTEN OR TURN US OFF NOW IF YOU HAVE CONSERVATIVE HOSTS GETTING MORE AND MORE AUDIENCE AND LIBERAL HOSTS NOT GETTING AUDIENCE THEN I THINK YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THE FREE MARKET HAS SPOKEN NOBODY IS FORCING PEOPLE TO LISTEN TO RADIO EITHER WAY 

KNOW THE YOU KNOW THE ONES TOM LIKESON G- FORMER GOVERNOR BROWN AND OTHERS MARIO CUOMO AND OTHERS WHO HAVE BEEN ON WHO HAVE FAILED MISERABLY IN THE MARKETPLACE BECAUSE FRANKLY PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO LISTEN TO THAT ANYMORE 

THERE WAS ACTUALLY A GUY ON SET AND ALL HE DID ALL DAY LONG WAS TOUCH UP THE BELTS AND SLAP A NEW STICKER ON ADAM WEST'S CHEST BECAUSE AS HE PERSPIRED THE STICKERS WOULD FALL OFF 

HE SAT AT THIS DESK FOR TWELVE OF HIS THIRTY YEARS ON THE AIR 

I AM A HUGE T. V. FAN THI- THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT I STARTED COLLECTING THESE PIECES BECAUSE NOBODY ELSE WAS DOING IT THEY WERE GOING INTO THE TRASH CANS THEY WERE BEING SHREDDED 

THIS IS SOMETHING THEY DID NOT WANT TO DEAL WITH IT JUST TOOK UP SPACE ON THEIR LOTS NOW OF COURSE I AM A GENIUS TEN YEARS AGO I WAS A FREAK WHO WOULD WANT TOM SELLECK'S SHIRT FROM MAGNUM P. I. WHAT KIND OF A SICK GUY IS THIS NOW I AM A GENIUS 

THESE ARE HER FAMOUS SUEDE BOOTS DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING THAT GOES WITH THAT 

WE REMOVE THE BOTTOM AND WHAT DO WE HAVE THIS IS MAXWELL SMART'S SHOE PHONE FROM THE GET SMART T. V. SERIES 

'CAUSE LOOK HOW LOVABLE HE LOOKS NOW RIGHT NOW WATCH THIS IF THIS FUR GOT 

THE SPONSOR WOULD ALWAYS MAKE SURE THAT SNUGGLE LOOKED HIS BEST AND HE OF COURSE IS A GREAT ICON OF T. V. HISTORY 

WHEN THEY WERE FILMING THE PILOT THE PRODUCERS GOT THIS LOVELY BOTTLE OF BOOZE AND THEY SAID YEAH THAT LOOKS LIKE A GENIE BOTTLE PAINT IT WE WILL USE THAT ONE 

WE HAVE MADE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF PROGRESS IN THE LAST FORTY FIVE HOURS BUT WE STILL HAVE ESCAPED THE SOLUTION TO THE TO THE TWO OR THREE OF THE KEY ISSUES AS WELL AS SOME OF THE LOCAL UNIONS STILL ARE ARE STRUGGLING TO TRY AND PUT TOGETHER LOCAL AGREEMENTS 

THEY ARE DOING A LOT MORE TRAFFIC STOPS THEY ARE DOING A LOT MORE CURFEW ENFORCEMENTS THEY ARE DOING A LOT MORE OF STOPPING YOUNG KIDS DURING SCHOOL HOURS YOU KNOW I THINK I THINK IT IS JUST BECOMING WE ARE BECOMING A MUCH BETTER TRAINED POLICE DEPARTMENT 

THIS DISTRICT IS THE BUSIEST CRIME WISE IN IN THE ENTIRE CITY PARTICULARLY WITH VIOLENT CRIMES SO WE DO HAVE A TREMENDOUS CRIME PROBLEM HERE THAT WE ARE JUST STARTING TO BE ABLE TO ATTACK 

MURDERS AND ROBBERIES AND DOPE SELLING AND IT IS CONTINUOUS 

WE HEAR COMPLAINTS ALL THE TIME I JUST CANNOT SIT HERE AND BE HONEST IF I WOULD TELL YOU THAT PEOPLE ARE MORE COMFORTABLE BECAUSE IN MY POSITION I I SPEAK WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE AND WE HEAR THE SAME STORIES OVER PEOPLE ARE STILL AFRAID TO WALK THE STREET AT NIGHT IN THE DAYTIME 

CARJACKERS WERE INCLUDED IN THAT SO THERE WAS TWENTY TWO OF THEM AND WE MANAGED TO CLEAR A HANDFUL OF THEM WHICH IS PRETTY GOOD AND WE HAVE 

AND WE WENT THROUGH A PERIOD WHERE WE WERE NOT DEPLOYING OUR OFFICERS PROPERLY YOU DID NOT ALWAYS SEE POLICE POLICE OFFICERS IN IN SOME OF OUR HIGH CRIME AREAS AND NOW YOU ARE STARTING TO SEE A A A STEADY STREAM OF OFFICERS IN SOME OF OUR HIGH CRIME NEIGHBORHOODS SO THOSE CITIZENS ARE NOW STARTING TO FEEL A LOT SAFER NOW WHETHER OR NOT YOU WILL EVER FEEL A HUNDRED PERCENT SAFE I DO NOT THINK THAT WILL EVER HAPPEN IN AMERICA BUT I THINK THERE IS SOME COMFORT LEVEL THAT PEOPLE HAVE WHEN THEY START TO SEE POLICE CARS AND POLICE OFFICERS WALKING FOOT BEATS 

HOW WIDESPREAD IS THIS PROBLEM 

HOW IS THE ARMY HANDLING THE PROBLEM SO FAR 

THE ARMY CHOSE TO HOLD A NEWS CONFERENCE TO PUBLICIZE THE INVESTIGATIONS WHICH SEEMS UNUSUAL WOULD WOULD THIS HAVE BEEN DONE IN THE PAST 

WHAT DO YOU MEAN 

MHM 

DOES THIS APPEAR TO BE A PROBLEM AFFECTING MORE RECRUITS THAN AFFECTING WOMEN WHO HAVE SERVED LONGER 

SO THIS IS ABUSE OF AUTHORITY AS WELL 

YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH 

THE IDEA OF DEVELOPING THE REGION'S ECONOMY SO THAT EVERYONE HAS AN ECONOMIC STAKE IN MAINTAINING PEACEFUL RELATIONS IS THAT A VIABLE ONE 

TWO YEARS AGO AT CASABLANCA SHIMON PERES OUTLINED A VISION FOR A REGIONAL COMMON MARKET IS THAT DEAD OR HAS IT JUST BEEN DELAYED 

EVEN BEFORE NETANYAHU WAS ELECTED TRADE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THOSE ARAB STATES WITH WHICH IT M- HAD MADE PEACE WAS VERY SLOW TO DEVELOP WHY IS THAT 

WHICH COUNTRIES STAND TO BENEFIT MOST FROM BETTER ECONOMIC RELATIONS 

IT WAS HOPED THAT PEACE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE P. L. O. WOULD IMPROVE THE LOT OF THE PALESTINIANS THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED EITHER 

IS THERE MORE THAT WESTERN NATIONS CAN DO TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC 

THANK YOU VERY MUCH 

IT WAS PRETTY EXCITING I MEAN HERE YOU KNOW WE DO NOT HAVE MUCH EVIDENCE OF OF SHALL WE SAY CLOSE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE NATIVE PEOPLES AND AND EARLY EUROPEAN VISITORS SO THAT WAS AN EXCITING PROSPECT IN ITS OWN RIGHT AND IT ALSO LEFT THE THE SHADOW OF DOUBT AS TO R- REALLY WHO WE WERE DEALING WITH HERE AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I DECIDED TO DETERMINE THE AGE OF IT 

THEY TELL US ABOUT THE NATURE OF MIGRATIONS TO THE NEW WORLD AND ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF THE PEOPLE WHO CAME TO THE NEW WORLD AND ABOUT THEIR RELATEDNESS TO OTHER POPULATIONS OF THEIR TIME SO IT IS A F- CONSIDERED TO BE A FIND OF NOT ONLY NATIONAL BUT OF INTERNATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE 

I AM IT IS A STORY ENTITLED EX PROSECUTOR RIPS DOLE FOR PARDON ATTACK 

PETER YOST OF THE A. P. FORMER IRAN CONTRA PROSECUTOR LAWRENCE WALSH ACCUSED BOB DOLE OF HYPOCRACY HYPOCRISY TUESDAY FOR TRYING TO USE A PARDON AG- ISSUE AGAINST CLINTON HE MENTIONS THAT DOLE SUCCESSFULLY URGED PARDONS FOR CRIMES OF CONSTITUTIONAL DIMENSION DURING THE IRAN CONTRA SCANDAL 

IT IS ON PAGE A. SEVEN 

WELL I THINK IT IS IT IS TRUE SENATOR DOLE IS BEING A HYPOCRITE HERE HE IS DESPERATE AND HE IS TRYING EVERYTHING HE CAN IN THE LAST M- THREE WEEKS AND HE CANNOT STAND UP TO A LOT OF THOSE ATTACKS HE HAS MAKE ESPECIALLY ABOUT CONTRIBUTIONS YOU SEE THAT GALLO WINE AND THEN THERE IS THE ARCHER DANIELS MIDLAND 

THERE BOTH SIDES DO IT THEY S- LIKE YOU SAID THEY SKATE AS CLOSE TO THE LAW AS THEY CAN AND I GUESS YOU MY FEELING IS YOU CANNOT COME DOWN HARD ON THE DEMOCRATS S- WITHOUT COMING DOWN HARD ON THE OTHER SIDE WE NEED A COMPLETE REVAMPING OF HOW WE FINANCE THESE CAMPAIGNS AND WE DO NOT HAVE IT NOW 

HELLO YES 

I AM HERE 

I AM HERE IN TAMPA 

GOOD MORNING HOW ARE 

WELL I AM READING THE KANSAS CITY STAR AND DOLE QUESTIONS HIS AUDIENCE SHOULD I BE TOUGHER OR NOT AND IT IS WRITTEN BY STEVE KRASKE 

WELL BASICALLY HE IS ASKING THE CROWD YOU KNOW DO I NEED TO BE TOUGHER SO HE SAID HE STRUGGLED OVER THE THE ARTICLE SAYS HE HAS STRUGGLED PUBLICLY FOR DAYS OVER WHETHER HE SHOULD ATTACK PRESIDENT CLINTON ON CHARACTER ISSUES AND HE RESOLVED HIS DILEMMA ON MONDAY IN KANSAS CITY AND BASICALLY HE IS GOING ON THE OFFENSIVE 

WELL I MEAN THE MEDIA AND EVERYBODY PORTRAYS POINTING OUT CHARACTER FLAWS AND FLAWS IN PUBLIC POLICY AND JUST OUT AND OUT LYING AS NEGATIVE ATTACKS 

AND IF YOU POINT OUT SOMETHING ABOUT A CH- PERSON'S CHARACTER AND IT HAPPENS TO BE NEGATIVE THEN IF THAT IS CHARACTERIZED ITSELF AS A NEGATIVE ATTACK THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE LANGUAGE WE ARE USING 

NEWSPEAK AND I THINK I CAN BLAME THE MEDIA ON THAT 

WELL I THINK AGAIN WE ARE JUST OVERPOLLING THE AMERICANS TO DEATH YOU KNOW IT IS I- IT I- YOU NAME IT THERE IS GOING TO BE A POLL FOR IT THE BOTTOM LINE IS I DO NOT THINK DOLE DOLE IS TOUGH AT ALL I DO NOT THINK EITHER HE NOR CLINTON NOR THE REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRATIC PARTY ARE TOUGH AT ALL ON THE ISSUES THEY THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT CIGARETTE SMOKING AND DRUG USE 

I THINK THEY NEED TO TALK ABOUT ENTITLEMENTS THEY NEED TO TALK ABOUT HOW THE CONSTITUTION IS BEING TRASHED THEY NEED TO TALK ABOUT HOW THIS COUNTRY IS BEING SPLINTERED AMONG VARIOUS ETHNIC GROUPS YOU KNOW THE HYPHENATION OF OUR COUNTRY IS KILLING US AND NO ONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THE MORALITY AND THE LACK THEREOF IN OUR COUNTRY AND THAT IS THE BIGGEST ISSUE THIS COUNTRY HAS TO DEAL WITH

I HAVE COME BACK AND PARTICIPATED IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS ACTUALLY I HAVE BECOME PRESIDENT OF A GROUP OF THREE THOUSAND MEN FROM MY CHURCH AND IT IS CALLED THE RICHARD ALLEN MEN'S SOCIETY THERE IS ANOTHER ORGANIZATION THAT I HELPED FOUND CALLED SUMMIT TWO THOUSAND AND WHAT IT IS IS A W- WE CA- FIVE OF US CAME TOGETHER SHORTLY AFTER THE MILLION MAN MARCH AND DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO TALK ABOUT A BALL GAME THAT WAS BEING PLAYED IN AMERICA THAT WE DID NOT REALLY PARTICIPATE IN WHICH IS CAPITALISM AND WE WE E- INCREDIBLY WITHIN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WE GOT SIXTEEN NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TO BUY INTO OUR PROGRAM OUR CONCEPT AND INCLUDING THE N. DOUBLE A. C. P. URBAN LEAGUE AND NATIONAL CONGRESS OF BLACK CHURCHES WHICH HAS A MEMBERSHIP OF NINETEEN MILLION AND WE HAVE BEEN DOING CONFERENCES AROUND THE COUNTRY SINCE THEN W- MOST RECENTLY IN WASHINGTON D. C. THE TWO DAYS PRECEDING THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS 

YES I WOULD AGREE IN A SENSE THEY THE ONLY THING IS THAT THAT THERE WAS THERE WAS A MOMENTUM THAT STARTED THAT I BELIEVE BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING THAT WAS DONE OPENLY IN F- IN IN THE PUBLIC IN THE IN THE MEDIA THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT THE THE MOMENTUM HAD DIED 

AND AS AS WITH ANYTHING ELSE THAT EVERY TIME YOU HA- YOU GO TO ANY KIND OF CONFERENCE WHETHER IT IS A HUNDRED PEOPLE OR A M- BILLION OR WHATEVER NUMBER AND YOU YOU TALK ABOUT SOME SOME INCH- ISSUES THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT ONCE YOU SPEAK YOU TALK YOU FEEL GOOD Y- YOU LEAVE IF NOTHING IS FO- IF THERE IS NO FOLLOW UP THEN THAT MOMENTUM DIES AND SO IN 

JUST A QUESTION OF NOW W- WHAT WHAT IS THE THE THE FOLLOW UP WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO NEXT 

WELL THAT THAT MEANS THAT IT IS A SUCCESS EVEN IF THERE WAS ONE PERSON WHO CHANGED YOU KNOW I MEAN YOU KNOW YOU CAN ALWAYS PICK AND FIND THE THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF ANYTHING BUT WHEN YO- WHEN I- IF THERE WAS CHANGE IN PEOPLE IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM THEN IT WAS A SUCCESS AND IT WAS A SUCCESS BECAUSE THERE WERE THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY OH I WOULD SAY THOUSANDS OF PE- OF MEN AROUND THE COUNTRY WHO HAVE CHANGED WHO ARE DOING INCREDIBLE THINGS NOW 

WELL IT IS AN ORGANIZATION OF MEN THAT COME TOGETHER IN FELLOWSHIP TO TALK ABOUT W- WELL WE C- TH- THINGS LIKE CLOSING CRACK HOUSES 

TALK TO THERE THERE ARE YOUNG MEN THAT COME IN THAT HAVE PROBLEMS HAVE SERIOUS PROBLEMS LIKE MAYBE THEIR THEIR WIFE LEFT THEM AND TOOK ALL THE KIDS YOU KNOW I MEAN THAT HAD THA- THAT TYPE OF SITUATION OR SOME ONE WHO JUST GOT OUT OF PRISON WHO HAS NO CHANCE FOR A JOB IN A SENSE AND SO YOU KNOW WE FELLOWSHIP WE TALK TO EACH OTHER AT THE SAME TIME THERE ARE SOME BUSINESS ENTREPRENEURS THERE ARE SOME POLITICAL PEOPLE THERE ARE SOME BUSINESS LEADERS SO IT IS THE FULL REALM OF OF MEN OF OCCUPATIONS AND WHAT WE DO IS WE COME TOGETHER ONCE A MONTH AND WE FELLOWSHIP WE TALK ABOUT I- ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO US WE BRING IN GUEST SPEAKERS AND AS A MATTER OF FACT THE THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER WE ARE ACTUALLY CHANGING THE PROGRAM AT THE CHURCH TO BE NOT CHANGING SO MUCH BUT ADDING SOMETHING WHICH IS IT IS THE MEN OF OF THE MONTH TH- IT IS WE ARE HONORING THE MEN OF THE MONTH I AM SORRY IT IS FOUR FORTY OUT HERE AND 

WELL THE THE MILLION MAN MARCH WAS WAS WAS BIGGER THAN FARRAKHAN I MEAN YOU KNOW BECAUSE HE CALLED IT YOU KNOW I W- I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED THAT BRIAN LAMB HAD ASKED ME WHY DID I COME YOU KNOW AND 'CAUSE TO ME THAT WAS THE KEY ISSUE AND I DID NOT JUST COME BECAUSE OF FARRAKHAN I C- I WAS EXCITED THAT HE WAS THE ONE THAT CALLED IT BECAUSE I SAID OH THIS IS GOING TO BE INTERESTING THIS WILL BE DIFFERENT AND I SO I LOOKED FORWARD TO GOING BUT THE REASON I CAME IS BECAUSE TH- YOU KNOW IT IS TIME FOR A CHANGE WE NEEDED SOMETHING AND LIKE I TOLD THIS WOMAN ON THE AIRLINES WHICH I HAD MENTIONED LAST YEAR SHE ASKED ME WHY WAS I GOING AND I SAID WELL YOU KNOW THE DEMONSTRATION YOU GIVE WITH THE OXYGEN MASK WHEN IT DROPS DOWN YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE A KID NEXT TO YOU YOU SHOULD NOT TRY TO HELP THE KID OR ANYONE ELSE UNTIL YOU PUT THE MASK ON AND YOU ARE SEEING CLEARLY AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT AND YOU ARE IN CONTROL THEN YOU CAN HELP SOMEONE ELSE AND THAT IS WHAT THE MILLION MAN MARCH WAS ALL ABOUT IS THAT AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN COMING TOGETHER DOING SOME INTROSPECTION LOOKING AT OURSELVES AND SAYING SERIOUSLY WE CANNOT MAKE ANY CH- HELP THIS COUNTRY MAKE ANY CHANGES IN THIS COUNTRY UNTIL WE CHANGE WITHIN OURSELVES AND I REALLY BELIEVE THAT IT WAS A MAJOR SUCCESS IN THAT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF MEN WHO ARE LOOKING INSIDE OF THEMSELVES AND TRYING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE NOW AND IT IS JUST THAT IT IS THEY ARE DOING IT IN THEIR OWN WAYS IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES IN THEIR OWN JOBS IN THEIR OWN BUSINESSES THEY ARE MORE ENTREPRENEURIAL TODAY PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO DO THINGS ON THEIR OWN DIFFERENTLY SAYING YOU KNOW THAT THEY GOT MOTIVATED FROM THE MILLION MAN MARCH BUT YOU JUST DO NOT SEE IT IN THE PRESS IT IS LIKE IT IS LIKE I HAVE RECEIVED IN THE PAST WEEK PHONE CALLS FROM THE L. A. 

FROM QUITE A FEW DIFFERENT PUBLICATIONS MEDIA AND E- WHY NOW WHY NOT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAR WHY NOT THREE MONTHS AFTER YOU KNOW IT IS JUST BECAUSE IT IS THE ANNIVERSARY WELL IF IF IF THE MEDIA WANTED TO HELP THEN EVERY MONTH THEY WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE MILLION MAN MARCH MOTIVATION THE ENERGY I MEAN YOU COULD DO THAT 

IT WAS MY PLEASURE AND ALSO ONE LAST 

I AM ALSO A FINANCIAL CONSULTANT WITH ONE OF THE LARGEST FIRMS ON WALL STREET 

I CANNOT SAY 

GREAT DAY 

GOOD MORNING I AM I AM A FIRST TIME CALLER I I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUICK COMMENTS FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I THINK THAT THAT IN LIEU OF THIS INDONESIAN CONTROVERSY AND ALL OF THIS THAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW THAT BOB DOLE AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS RESORTED TO A KIND OF DESPERATION IN THE SORT OF THE ELEVENTH HOUR OF THIS FOUNDERING CAMPAIGN AND MY OTHER COMMENT BEING A BLACK AMERICAN A- AFRICAN AMERICAN I THINK THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY JUST DOES NOT GET IT BECAUSE WHAT PEOPLE TENDS TO BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS SOME OF THE DIVISIONS THAT ARE GOING ON RIGHT NOW AND BECAUSE OF BLACKS AND WOMEN AND AND GAYS AND OTHER MINORITIES IN THIS COUNTRY THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY DOES NOT SEEM TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THEY ARE ARE GOING TO LOSE IN NOVEMBER 

I AM PREPARED T- TO DO WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO PASS IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WITH AN AMENDMENT THAT THAT OUR PARTY HAS AGREED TO SAYING THAT WE SHOULD NOT HAVE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM FOREIGN NATIONALS WHO ARE OTHERWISE WHO ARE CAN CAN LEGALLY GIVE MONEY NOW 

GOOD MORNING MARTIN THAT COLD SPELL CONTINUES IT IS FEELING MORE LIKE MID DECEMBER OUT THERE AND TODAY WILL BE NO EXCEPTION SUNSHINE IN THE MORNING SOME CLOUDS BUILDING A LITTLE LATER ON BUT BREEZY AND COLD THAT IS THE MAIN STORY THE HIGH ONLY FORTY WITH WESTERLY WINDS AT TEN TO TWENTY TONIGHT CLEARING SKIES AND EVEN COLDER THAN LAST NIGHT LOWS TWENTY TWO IN THE OUTLYING AREAS TWENTY SEVEN FOR A LOW IN CENTER CITY WITH JUST A LIGHT WIND THEN WEDNESDAY SUNSHINE AND CLOUDS MIX AGAIN THE HIGH FORTY ONE I AM METEOROLOGIST CHRIS EDWARDS WITH THE EXCLUSIVE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE FORECAST 

YES ACTUALLY IT DID THIS IS THE WORST NOVEMBER SNOWSTORM THAT WE HAVE HAD IN MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS HERE THE COMBINATION OF HEAVY WET SNOW AND STRONG WINDS COMING OFF OF LAKE ERIE COMBINE TO BRING DOWN A LOT OF TREES A LOT OF TREE LIMBS AND A IT IT HAS REALLY CREATED HAVOC THROUGHOUT NORTHEASTERN OHIO 

ON ACCEPTING THIS CO- COMPROMISE WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO STRETCH OUR FUNDRAISING CAPABILITIES AND WE BELIEVE IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE OUR SOUGHT AFTER FINANCIAL STABILITY UNDER THE PROPOSAL HOWEVER IN THE INTERESTS OF OBTAINING A SETTLEMENT AND HEARING THE PHILADELPHIA ORCHESTRA PLAY AGAIN WE THOUGHT IT IMPERATIVE THAT WE MAKE FURTHER CONCESSIONS 

THE WORST PRIOR TO THIS THAT WE HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED WAS ABOUT FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND CUSTOMERS WHICH IS SIZABLE BUT IT IS NOT THAT BAD WHEN YOU COMPARE IT WITH A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND CUSTOMERS AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER HERE 

IT IS REALLY NOT OUT OF CHARACTER FOR OUR AREA PEOPLE START TO EXPECT IT AROUND THE FIRST OF NOVEMBER USUALLY TAKES A STORM OR TWO TO GET PEOPLE BACK INTO THEIR WINTER DRIVING HABITS 

IT LOOKS LIKE THAT SHOULD BE THE THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF THE HEAVY STUFF WE WILL STILL SEE SNOW SHOWERS LINGERING IN THE TRADITIONAL LAKE EFFECT AREAS TUESDAY NIGHT BUT THEY SHOULD BECOME A LITTLE MORE SCATTERED AND THEN TAPER TO MAINLY FLURRIES MAYBE A SNOW SHOWER OR TWO ON WEDNESDAY BUT BY THEN ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE CUT TO NEXT TO NOTHING 

WE HAD HAD HIGH HOPES FOR AN EARLY SETTLEMENT BUT WE DID FIND IT SURPRISING WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE THAT THE IMPASSE BROKE DOWN LAST NIGHT AND THAT WE WERE ABLE TO COME TO AGREEMENT AND WE ARE VERY PLEASED THAT WE CAN NOW GO TO WORK ON PUTTING THIS STRIKE BEHIND US 

LOWERING THOSE BARRIERS MEANS THAT THE BANKS WILL BE ABLE TO THROUGH S- PROPERLY CREATED SUBSIDIARIES ENTER THE SECURITIES BUSINESS SECURITIES COMPANIES WILL BE ABLE TO ENTER PARTS OF THE BANKING BUSINESS WHOLESALE AND RETAIL OPERATIONS WILL BE ABLE TO BE MERGED A LITTLE BIT MORE CLOSELY 

ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU WILL NOT BE IN CAIRO FOR THE REGIONAL ECONOMIC SUMMIT BUT SOME ANALYSTS ARE SAYING HIS HARD LINE POLICIES TOWARD THE PEACE PROCESS WILL STILL BE FELT TWO YEARS AGO AT THE CASABLANCA CONFERENCE SHIMON PERES THEN ISRAEL'S FOREIGN MINISTER SPOKE OF A NEW MIDDLE EAST IT WAS A REGION HE FORESAW AT PEACE WITH ITSELF CHANNELING WESTERN INVESTMENT ISRAELI KNOW HOW AND ARAB LABOR AND RAW MATERIALS TO PRODUCE A PROSPEROUS REGIONAL COMMON MARKET BUT THAT VISION HAS ALL BUT DISAPPEARED FOLLOWING NETANYAHU'S VICTORY THIS SPRING IN THE ISRAELI ELECTIONS 

WALID KAZZIHA IS A PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE AT THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY IN CAIRO 

HE CITES AS EXAMPLES THE RECENT FAILURE TO STRIKE A DEAL ON THE ISRAELI REDEPLOYMENT FROM HEBRON THAT COMES ON THE HEELS OF THE OUTBREAK OF VIOLENCE LAST MONTH BETWEEN ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS SPARKED BY NETANYAHU'S CONTROVERSIAL DECISION TO OPEN AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL TUNNEL UNDER JERUSALEM'S TEMPLE MOUNT AND THERE IS THE CONTINUED CLOSURE OF THE WEST BANK AND THE GAZA STRIP THAT IS KEEPING THOUSANDS OF PALESTINIANS FROM WORKING IN ISRAEL JORDAN OMAN AND QATAR THE THREE ARAB GOVERNMENTS WHICH HAVE MOVED AGGRESSIVELY IN ESTABLISHING COMMERCIAL LINKS WITH ISRAEL HAVE PUBLICLY BACKED AWAY SINCE NETANYAHU'S ELECTION AND EGYPT ISRAEL'S OLDEST FRIEND IN THE ARAB WORLD THREATENED TO CANCEL OR POSTPONE THE ECONOMIC SUMMIT UNLESS NETANYAHU TOOK SPECIFIC STEPS TO MODIFY HIS POLICIES 

SAAD EDDIN IBRAHIM IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE IBN KHALDOUN CENTER A CAIRO THINK TANK HE SAID PUBLIC OPINION IN EGYPT WAS STILL EVENLY DIVIDED ON WHETHER TO HOST THE ECONOMIC SUMMIT WHILE THE DREAM OF CREATING A REGIONAL ECONOMIC COMMUNITY HAS DIMMED IN THE EYES OF MANY IBRAHIM SAYS IT HAS NOT DISAPPEARED HE SAID THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CONFERENCE AND THOSE PLANNED IN THE FUTURE COULD MAKE PROGRESS TOWARD THAT GOAL LIKE INAUGURATING A REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT BANK DESPITE ISRAEL'S NEW GOVERNMENT 

ALTHOUGH GOVERNMENTS IN THE REGION CONTINUE TO LOWER BARRIERS TO PROMOTE FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND TRADE MOST OF THEIR LINKS REMAIN WITH THE WESTERN INDUSTRIAL NATIONS NOT EACH OTHER AND THAT IS SOMETHING THE PEACE PROCESS AND THE CHARACTER OF ANY GOVERNMENT OR GOVERNMENTS IN THE REGION IS UNLIKELY TO CHANGE ANY TIME SOON I AM SUNNI KHALID IN CAIRO 

GOOD MORNING BOB 

WELL NOT ONLY IS IT VIABLE BUT I THINK IT IS REALLY A NECESSARY CONDITION FOR THIS S- TO SUCCEED BECAUSE YOU KNOW THESE ARE THE LOGICAL TRADING PARTNERS FOR THE PALESTINIANS THEY BUY THE GOODS THAT THE PALESTINIANS MAKE AND THEY HAVE A COMMON CULTURE AND IT IS KIND OF ODD THAT THIS HAS NOT TAKEN HOLD YET 

WELL IT IS IT IT IS A IT A I DO NOT THINK IT IS DEAD I- IT JUST I DO NOT THINK I- I THINK IT WAS PREMATURE WHEN HE MADE THOSE IT WAS A VISION SO IT WAS PREMATURE AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME STEPS THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE BEFORE WE GET THERE I MEAN THAT THIS MEETING SHOWS THAT THERE STILL IS A STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE PEACE PROCESS BECAUSE OF ALL THESE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE SHOWN UP AT THE CAIRO S- AT THE SO- CAIRO EX- E- CONFERENCE BUT I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS START SHIFTING OUR THOUGHTS AWAY FROM PROFITING FROM PEACE TO CREATING JOBS BUILDING HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE TERRITORIES TO HELP ACHIEVE THAT PEACE WE HAVE NOT YET ACHIEVED IT TO START PROFITING FROM IT AND SO WE ARE A LITTLE BIT WE ARE PUTTING THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE SO ONCE WE DO THAT REARRANGEMENT THEN I THINK WE CAN ES- YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY GET TO THAT GOAL 

WELL I THINK THERE ARE A COUPLE OF REASONS AND THE THE BEST CASE IS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND EGYPT WHICH HAS NOW BEEN AT A AT A PEACE FOR TWENTY YEARS AND AND THAT IS THAT FIRST OF ALL THEY DO NOT SHARE A COMMON CULTURE SO THEY DO NOT SHARE A LOT OF THE THE SAME KINDS OF TASTES AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND IN ADDITION THE INCOMES ARE SO DIFFERENT SO ISRAEL PRODUCES GOODS THAT ARE NOW CONSUMED BY THE INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES AND THAT IS THEIR TRADITIONAL MARKETS AND I DO NOT THINK ISRAEL SHOULD SHIFT FROM THOSE MARKETS REALLY IT IS THE REGIONAL POWERS THE ARAB COUNTRIES THE PALESTINIANS THAT SHOULD BE TRADING WITH EACH OTHER BECAUSE THEY DO SHARE IN TERMS OF THE SAME LEVELS OF INCOME AND THE SAME KINDS OF TASTES 

WELL THEY I MEAN I THINK ALL OF THE REGIONAL COUNTRIES DO I MEAN EGYPT HAS NOW YOU KNOW IMPROVED ITS ECONOMY HA- GONE THROUGH SOME REFORMS RECENTLY BUT M- MOST OF THEM HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO AND AS WE KNOW TRADE AND CERTAINLY WITHIN THE REGIONS YOU KNOW IF YOU TAKE EUROPE FOR EXAMPLE THAT REALLY CAN HELP COUNTRIES DEVELOP AND SO THEY COULD ALL BE HELPING EACH OTHER MOVE AHEAD IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW SHIFTING THEIR KINDS OF PRODUCTION TO HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY KINDS OF THINGS AND HIGHER INCOMES SO THAT IS REALLY A FIRST STEP FOR ALL OF THEM TO DO AND IN FACT YOU REALLY DO NOT NEED TO HAVE MUCH MORE DEVELOPMENT ON THE PEACE SIDE TO DO IT IT WOULD IN FACT HELP THE PALESTINIANS GET AROUND THEIR PROBLEM WITH THE CLOSURE IN GETTING THEIR GOODS INTO ISRAEL BECAUSE THEY COULD JUST GET THEIR GOODS OUT INTO JORDAN OR OVER TO EGYPT AND THOSE BORDERS ARE NOT AS RESTRICTED AS THEY ARE LET US SAY BETWEEN THE PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES AND ISRAEL 

THAT IS RIGHT AND IN FACT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF AT THIS TIME AT THIS CONFERENCE YOU KNOW EVERYONE HAS KIND OF BENEFITED A LITTLE BIT ISRAEL ECONOMY HAS BEEN DOING WELL THE EGYPTIAN ECONOMY HAS BEEN REFORMED THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOTHING TO SHOW FOR ALL OF THIS IS THE PALESTINIANS WHO REALLY ARE THE PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT LINK IN THE WHOLE PROCESS UNEMPLOYMENT THERE IS ESTIMATED TO BE AS HIGH AS MAYBE SEVENTY PERCENT AND IT IS NOT CLEAR THAT THERE HAS BEEN ANY NEW HOUSING BUILT OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS SO THAT IS REALLY WHERE THE EFFORT SHOULD BE FO- SHOULD BE PLACED RIGHT NOW 

IN FACT IT TOOK THE UNITED STATES THREE YEARS TO CORRECT ITS RULES SO THAT WE COULD IMPORT PALESTINIAN GOODS WITHOUT DISCRIMINATING AGAINST THEM AS WE DI- YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT A COUNTRY OR A TERRITORY THAT TOOK US THREE YEARS TO DO WE JUST DID THAT TWO MONTHS AGO AND YOU KNOW THE UNITED STATES SHOULD BE APPLAUDED FOR THAT BUT THAT IS WHAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE FIRST STEPS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE THIS FOCUS ON AID AND MAKING COMMITMENTS OF NUMBERS BUT NEVER DELIVERING ON IT IS IS SOMETHING THAT JUST IS NOT HELPFUL AND CONSTRUCTIVE AND SO WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS WE MEANING THE UNITED STATES EUROPEANS THE JAPANESE WE REALLY HAVE TO START GETTING SOME CAPITAL IN THERE INTO THE TERRITORIES TO BUILD UP SOME INFRASTRUCTURE GET THESE PEOPLE IN SOME S- INTO SOME SERIOUS HOUSING AND AND AND START CREATING SOME JOBS THERE CREATING FACTS ON THE GROUND BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE JOBS IT GIVES THEM A LOT OF TIME TO START DISRUPTING THINGS AND THROWING STONES SO WE REALLY GOT TO GET THE M- JOBS TO PEOPLE AND WE GOT TO GET SOME HOUSING 

OKAY THANK YOU 

WE AS INDIAN PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HERE WE DID NOT CROSS NO BRIDGE AND THE FACT THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL IS SO OLD THERE IS NO OTHER CONCLUSION NOW WHAT WE AS INDIAN PEOPLE CAN DRAW ALL WE KNOW IS THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL IS NATIVE AMERICAN PERIOD 

WHAT OUR RELIGION TELLS US AND OUR OLDER PEOPLE AS WELL IS THAT ONCE A BODY GOES INTO THE GROUND THAT IS WHERE IT IS TO STAY AND THIS IS WHAT WE FIRMLY BELIEVE IS THAT BECAUSE THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS INADVERTENTLY EXPOSED IT IS OUR DUTY AND OUR INHERENT RIGHT TO PUT THIS INDIVIDUAL BACK IN THE GROUND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 

SO SOMEONE WHO D- WHO LIVED HERE AND DIED NINETY FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO THAT PERSON MAY HAVE BEEN INDIGENOUS NINETY FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO BUT THAT PERSON IS NOT NATIVE AMERICAN UNLESS THAT PERSON HAS A RELATIONSHIP TO PRESENT DAY NATIVE AMERICANS 

THOSE REMAINS NEED TO BE CAREFULLY EXAMINED IN ORDER TO IN ORDER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION THAT CAN TELL US ABOUT THAT TIME PERIOD AND AND CERTAINLY I- IT IS A RARE OPPORTUNITY 

THE WAY THIS ONE IS BEING ARGUED BY BOTH SIDES THERE JUST DOES NOT FEEL LIKE THERE IS A WHOLE LOT OF MIDDLE GROUND IN THIS CASE THE CORPS IS IN THE MIDDLE AS THE CUSTODIAN OF THE REMAINS WITH OPPOSING INTERESTS COMPETING FOR THEM 

THE RECORDS FOR THE STOCK MARKET JUST KEEP POURING IN THE SEVENTH RECORD IN A ROW FOR THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE HAPPENED TODAY AFTER THE GOVERNMENT REPORTED SOME NEWS THAT SUGGESTS LOWER INFLATION AHEAD 

WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING IN AMERICA IS THAT BLACK MEN HAVE NOT BEEN STANDING TOGETHER IF A YEAR AGO IF YOU HAD TOLD ME THAT BLACK MEN WERE GOING TO COME TOGETHER AND BE AS MANY AS THEY ARE HERE OR EVEN HALF THIS MANY I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU YOU ARE DREAMING NEVER I- ARE BLACK MEN GOING TO EVER COME TOGETHER AND DO ANYTHING POSITIVE LIKE THIS IT WAS ONE OF MY DREAMS BUT I DID NOT THINK IT WOULD HAPPEN AND NOW LOOK AT THIS 

STILL TO COME A SPACED OUT COLLECTION OF HOLLYWOOD TREASURES THIS STUFF IS WORTH PLENTY OF DOUGH BOY AND TOMORROW AN ALL STAR CAST IN THE SLEEPER HIT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH DOES NOT WANT YOU TO SEE

EVERYONE WHO LIVES IN THIS CITY HAS TO SHOULDER THE BURDEN TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE CRIME PROBLEM WE HAVE TO THE CITIZENS HAVE TO KNOW THAT THEY CAN PICK UP THE PHONE AND THEY CAN CALL THE POLICE AND THE POLICE ARE GOING TO COME AND THEY ARE GOING TO HELP THEY HAVE TO KNOW THAT 

YOU CALL YOU ARE WASTING YOUR TIME 

YOU ARE WASTING YOUR TIME AND THEN YOU GET HARASSED BEHIND IT THEN IF YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE COPS THEY HARASS YOU BEHIND 

MASHHAD'S CENTRAL RAILROAD STATION HAS BECOME A GATEWAY TO THE STATES OF CENTRAL ASIA JUST HALF A YEAR AGO THE IRANIANS COMPLETED A NEW RAILROAD COVERING THE EIGHTY MILES OF DESERT TO TURKMENISTAN FROM THERE TURKMENISTAN LAID ANOTHER ONE HUNDRED FORTY MILES OF TRACK TO THE RAILROAD THAT RUNS THROUGH CENTRAL ASIA CONSTRUCTED BY RUSSIA A CENTURY AGO 

THE RAILROAD RUNS ALMOST PRECISELY WHERE THE ORIGINAL SILK ROAD LAY THROUGH MUD HUT VILLAGES WITH NAMES LIKE KARZAR AND SHUVOK MOLACHY THE DESERT IS DUSTY BROWN AND WERE IT NOT FOR THE PAVED ROAD THE TELEPHONE WIRES AND THE OCCASIONAL PAINTED BILLBOARD FOR ZAM ZAM THE LOCAL ORANGE SODA ONE COULD IMAGINE CAMEL CARAVANS PLYING THIS SAME ROAD A MILLENNIUM AGO THERE ARE STILL RUINS OF THE RABATS WHERE THE CARAVANS MIGHT HAVE STOPPED FOR THE NIGHT ON THEIR WAY TO MASHHAD 

AT THE BORDER POST TWO HUGE PAINTED PORTRAITS OF AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI AND IRAN'S CURRENT SPIRITUAL LEADER AYATOLLAH KHAMENEI ARE THE LAST SIGHT BEFORE CROSSING INTO TURKMENISTAN THE NEWS AND MUSIC BLARE OUT FROM TEHRAN RADIO INTO THE HOT AFTERNOON SUN THERE IS A NEW RAILROAD BRIDGE THE BRIDGE OF FRIENDSHIP CONNECTING THE TWO COUNTRIES NEAR THE ANCIENT BRICK SILK ROAD FOOTBRIDGE NOW SITTING UNUSED AND IDLE THIS IS THE TOWN OF SARAKHS AND THE IRANIANS HOPE PERHAPS GRANDIOSELY 

THAT THE VOLUME OF TRADE SOON TO PASS THROUGH THIS TOWN OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND COULD SURPASS EVEN THE TRAFFIC THROUGH THE SUEZ CANAL 

SO THE IRANIANS ARE BUILDING AN ENORMOUS COMPLEX OF MODERN BUILDINGS HERE COMPLETE WITH HOTELS AN AIRPORT CAPABLE OF LANDING SEVEN FORTY SEVENS AND EXHIBITION HALLS IT IS CALLED THE SARAKHS FREE TRADE ZONE SO FAR THE IRANIANS HAVE ERECTED ONLY A HUGE WHITE TENT WITH EIGHT PEAKS SOARING TWO HUNDRED FEET INTO THE SKY AND HOVERING OVER THE DESERT LIKE A MIRAGE IT WAS HERE LAST MAY THAT IRAN'S PRESIDENT HASHEMI RAFSANJANI INAUGURATED THE NEW SILK ROAD RAILWAY SAYS RAJID AFORE A SITE MANAGER OF THE PROJECT 

THE PROJECT IS MEANT TO SIMPLIFY TRADE BY REDUCING TARIFFS 

THE U. S. IS A FEDERAL REPUBLIC THE WORLD'S ONLY SUPERPOWER BRITAIN IS A CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY A COUNTRY IN DECLINE WHAT CAN A SLICK AMERICAN POLITICAL OPERATOR LIKE STEPHANOPOLOUS POSSIBLY BRING TO A BRITISH ELECTION CAMPAIGN MARTIN WALKER WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT OF THE BRITISH GUARDIAN NEWSPAPER 

LABOR WHILE WAY AHEAD OF THE RULING CONSERVATIVE PARTY IN THE OPINION POLLS NOW HAS LOST FOUR GENERAL ELECTIONS IN A ROW STEPHANOPOLOUS SAYS WALKER CAN SHOW LABOR HOW TO PLAY HARDBALL HOW TO USE RUTHLESS RAPID REACTION TACTICS 

THE LABOR LEADERSHIP HAS WARMLY ACCEPTED STEPHANOPOLOUS OFFER OF ADVICE AND HELP BUT BORIS JOHNSON OF THE DAILY TELEGRAPH IN LONDON THINKS THERE COULD BE TROUBLE LOWER DOWN THE LABOR PARTY RANKS 

SINCE CLINTON'S FIRST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION VICTORY LABOR POLITICIANS HAVE BEEN FREQUENT VISITORS TO WASHINGTON THEY HAVE STUDIED CLINTON CLOSELY THEY SEE HIM AS A MASTER OF THE POLITICAL CRAFT THEY HAVE ADOPTED A SIMILAR STRATEGY LIKE THE DEMOCRATS LABOR HAS SHIFTED TO THE RIGHT MONOPOLIZING THE CENTER GROUND STEALING THEIR OPPONENTS' CLOTHES BUT BORIS JOHNSON OF THE TELEGRAPH DOES NOT BELIEVE STEPHANOPOLOUS WILL BE ABLE TO DO FOR LABOR WHAT HE HAS DONE FOR THE DEMOCRATS 

LABOR MIGHT DO WELL TO REMEMBER THE LAST MAJOR EPISODE OF TRANSATLANTIC ELECTORAL COOPERATION IT INVOLVED CONSERVATIVE PARTY OFFICIALS FROM BRITAIN GOING TO WASHINGTON THEY WENT TO ADVISE GEORGE BUSH ON HOW TO WIN A SECOND TERM IN LONDON THIS IS STEPHEN BEARD FOR MARKETPLACE 

SO INTENSE HAS BEEN THE GLOOM SURROUNDING THE PEACE PROCESS IN RECENT MONTHS THAT THIS CONFERENCE NEARLY DID NOT HAPPEN AT ALL EGYPT ONLY WENT AHEAD WITH HOSTING THE EVENT OUT OF THE DETERMINATION TO PROMOTE ITS OWN ECONOMIC REFORM PROGRAM AND TO LURE URGENTLY NEEDED FOREIGN INVESTMENT CERTAINLY THE EUPHORIA THAT SURROUNDED THE TWO PREVIOUS MIDDLE EAST ECONOMIC SUMMITS HELD IN CASABLANCA AND AMMAN WILL BE MISSING ABSENT AS WELL ARE MANY TOP LEVEL POLITICAL LEADERS REFLECTING EGYPT'S DECISION TO PROMOTE THE EVENT AS A CONFERENCE RATHER THAN A SUMMIT BUT IN PLACE OF THE POLITICIANS HAVE COME A LARGER NUMBER OF BUSINESS EXECUTIVES INCLUDING MANY FROM ASIA EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES HOPEFUL THAT LUCRATIVE DEALS AND INVESTMENTS CAN STILL BE MADE DESPITE THE DETERIORATING POLITICAL CLIMATE 

I THINK IT WOULD BE FAIR TO SAY THAT THE ASSOCIATION'S PROPOSAL AMOUNTS TO A PAY CUT OF TEN TO FIFTEEN PERCENT PER MUSICIAN 

THIS IS THE WORLD I AM EDDIE MAIR IN LONDON WITH TONY KAHN IN BOSTON 

IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ORDER A CASSETTE COPY OF TODAY'S PROGRAM YOU CAN HERE IS HOW JUST PICK UP YOUR PHONE AND DIAL THREE OH THREE EIGHT TWO THREE EIGHT THOUSAND AGAIN TO ORDER A CASSETTE COPY OF THE WORLD CALL THREE OH THREE EIGHT TWO THREE EIGHT THOUSAND AND TONY WILL RUN RIGHT OVER WITH IT TO YOU ALTHOUGH THAT IS NOT LEGALLY BINDING YOU ARE LISTENING TO THE WORLD FROM P. R. I. ON AMONG OTHERS W. C. P. N. IN CLEVELAND WHICH IS STILL DIGGING ITSELF OUT OF A MID AUTUMM SNOWSTORM HOPE YOU ARE OKAY THERE THIS IS P. R. I. PUBLIC RADIO INTERNATIONAL 

IT IS MOSTLY BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN ALMOST TIGHTROPE WALKING IN IN THE ECONOMIC STATISTICS WE CONTINUE TO SEE NUMBERS THAT POINT TO TO ONGOING GROWTH ONGOING PROFITS GROWTH WHICH IS VERY GOOD FOR STOCKS AND ON TOP OF THAT WE CONTINUE TO SEE NUMBERS THAT SUGGEST LOWER INTEREST RATES TO COME WHICH ALSO IS VERY GOOD FOR FOR STOCKS AND THE RESULT HAS BEEN A REAL BOOM IN SHARE PRICES 

I THINK IT IS ALTHOUGH I I WOULD BEGIN TO BE A LITTLE WARY AT THESE LEVELS MOSTLY BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD A STRING OF ALMOST UNINTERRUPTED GOOD NEWS FROM THE THE FOLKS WHO WHO PUT THE DATA TOGETHER DOWN IN WASHINGTON AND THAT IS NOT GOING TO LAST FOREVER WE ARE BOUND TO SEE A REPORT EVENTUALLY THAT IS EITHER STRONG ENOUGH TO SUGGEST HIGHER RATES OR WEAK ENOUGH TO SUGGEST WEAKER PROFITS BUT SO FAR WE HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT GOOD NEWS IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS 

WELL THE THICK SMOKE FROM THE BLAZE IS CLEARING TODAY THE NATIONAL OIL COMPANY PEMEX AND DIRECTOR ADRIAN LAJOUS ARE DRAWING FIRE FROM MEXICAN LEGISLATORS OPPOSITION PARTY LEADERS ARE CALLING FOR THE DIRECTOR TO STEP DOWN AND ENVIRONMENTALISTS WANT PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY SOMETHING OIL EXPERTS HERE SAY DOES NOT EXIST DAVID SHIELDS A COLUMNIST WHO COVERS OIL FOR THE DAILY EL FINANCIERO SAYS THIS EXPLOSION IS BEING CAREFULLY WATCHED BY FOREIGN INVESTORS 

CERTAINLY FOREIGN INVESTORS ARE WORRIED WHEN THEY SEE SO MANY ACCIDENTS AT PEMEX BECAUSE THIS IS THE THIRD MAJOR ACCIDENT TOT- IN A OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS 

THAT DOES NOT COUNT THE TRAGEDY IN GUADALAJARA FOUR YEARS AGO TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE DIED AFTER THE CITY'S NATURAL GAS SYSTEM VIRTUALLY BLEW UP PRESIDENT ERNESTO ZEDILLO SAYS THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONSIDER MOVING GASOLINE STORAGE FACILITIES AWAY FROM URBAN AREAS AND PEMEX DIRECTOR ADRIAN LAJOUS SAYS PEMEX MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES WILL BE MADE PUBLIC BEGINNING IN DECEMBER IN MEXICO CITY I AM FRANK CONTRERAS FOR MARKETPLACE 

NOW SOME FINAL NOTES 

THURSDAY NOVEMBER FOURTEENTH SPECIAL PRODUCTION ASSISTANCE TODAY WAS PROVIDED BY K. P. B. S. IN SAN DIEGO TODAY THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE GAINED MORE THAN THIRTY EIGHT POINTS I AM DAVID BRANCACCIO 

IN THE MINDS OF THE PUBLIC I WOULD SAY THERE PROBABLY WAS A FEELING OF LETDOWN THAT THERE WAS NO FOLLOW UP BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW AND THEY STILL DO NOT KNOW THAT MUCH THAT THERE ARE QUITE A FEW THINGS GOING ON IN THE COUNTRY THAT HAS BEGUN TO BUILD MOMENTUM THAT WILL BE TALKED ABOUT MORE AND MORE 

OH NO IT WAS A SUCCESS IT IS THE FOLLOW UP IS THE QUES- IS THE 

THE M- THE MILLION MAN MARCH WAS SUCCESSFUL 

GOOD BOY ROBIN 

DAVIS IN NEW YORK WITH WORLDVIEW MONEY 

POLITICIANS AND EVERYONE CONCERNING LAW WILL HAVE TO OPEN HIS EYES AND AND SEE THAT THE BELGIAN AUDIENCE DOES NOT AGREE ANYMORE WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING 

ACROSS NORTH AMERICA AS YOU SEE WHAT THEY WERE DOING YESTERDAY TRYING TO DRY OUT THE FIELD THEY MIGHT HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN TODAY 

QUITE A SIGHT YESTERDAY IF YOU MISSED YOUR FORECAST THERE YOU MAY CATCH IT ON C. N. N. INTERACTIVE WHERE THERE ARE OVER FOUR HUNDRED FORECAST WITH FOUR DAY FOUR HUNDRED FORECASTS WITH FOUR DAY CITIES ON THERE THAT IS THE LATEST LOOK AT YOUR WEATHER 

SHE MAY BE THE MOST PHOTOGRAPHED WOMAN IN THE WORLD WITH A FACE THAT CAMERAS LOVE BUT THE FEELING IS NOT MUTUAL A PRINCESS PLAYS HIDE AND SEEK WITH THE PAPARAZZI WE WILL BE BACK IN A FLASH WHEN PRIME TIME CONTINUES 

HE CAN BRING THE THE SHEER SELF CONFIDENCE THAT COMES FROM HAVING BEEN PART OF A WINNING TEAM NOW TWICE 

THAT IS WHAT HE HAS BEEN DOING FOR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN THIS TIME AND IT GOT IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE EVERY TIME THAT BOB DOLE WAS ABOUT TO MAKE A CHARGE AGAINST BILL CLINTON ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL EVEN BEFORE HE SPOKE THERE WOULD BE DEMOCRATIC OFFICIALS HANDING OUT THE PRESS INSTANT PRE REBUTTALS 

I THINK THERE IS GOING TO BE A QUESTION WHEN HE ARRIVES ABOUT HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THE SPIN DOCTORS AND RAPID RESPONSE UNITS THEY HAVE ALREADY GOT WHERE IS THIS CHARACTER STEPHANOPOLOUS GOING TO FIT IN I CAN SEE ROOM FOR SEVERAL JEALOUSIES AND RESENTMENTS ALREADY 

THEY ARE TWO VERY VERY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WITH TOTALLY DIFFERENT STRUCTURE OF THE ECONOMY AND TOTALLY DIFFERENT POLITICAL AGENDA AND WHAT IS RIGHT WING IN AMERICA IS VERY VERY RIGHT WING OVER HERE SO I DO NOT THINK I DO NOT THINK THAT THERE IS ANY REAL TRANSLATION FROM THE ONE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT TO THE OTHER 

YOU HAVE TO FOCUS ON SMALL THINGS LIKE ABANDONED VEHICLES LOITERING ILLEGAL DRINKING STREET CORNER SALES OF DRUGS AND THEN BY ADDRESSING THAT THE PROVERBIAL BROKEN WINDOW THAT IT HAS AN OVERALL EFFECT ON VIOLENT CRIME 

CANADA IS OFFERING TO SEND A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MEMBER CANADIAN FORCES MOBILE UNITS KNOWN AS THE DISASTER ASSISTANCE RESPONSE TEAM OR DART AN EXTREMELY FLEXIBLE UNIT CREATED BY THE CANADIANS DURING THE RWANDAN CRISIS IT WOULD INCLUDE COMMUNICATIONS OFFICERS EXPERIENCED U. N. PEACEKEEPERS AND A FIELD HOSPITAL CAPABLE OF TREATING FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE A DAY THE FORCE WOULD ONLY CARRY LIGHT SIDE ARMS WHILE THE U. S. HAS BEEN INDECISIVE ABOUT SENDING TROOPS AND FRANCE HAS OFFERED TO SEND A THOUSAND SOLDIERS CANADA IS SEEN AS A COUNTRY WITH NO COLONIAL ROOTS AND A LONG RECORD OF U. N. PEACEKEEPING CANADA PROPOSES LEADING A MUCH LARGER MULTILATERAL FORCE WHICH WOULD INCLUDE THE U. S. THE CANADIAN PROPOSAL APPARENTLY CAME DIRECTLY FROM PRIME MINISTER JEAN CHRETIEN FOR NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO THIS IS LEE CARTER IN TORONTO 

THUS HAS IRAN REIMAGINED AND TAKEN THE LEAD IN RECREATING THE SILK ROAD THERE IS ONCE AGAIN A ROUTE FOR THE PEOPLES OF CENTRAL ASIA TO SELL THEIR GOODS TO THE MIDDLE EAST AND THE REST OF THE WORLD THROUGH THE RAIL AND ROAD SYSTEM AND THE WARM WATER PORTS OF IRAN IRAJ KAZEMIAN WAS ONE OF THE ARCHITECTS OF WHAT THE IRANIANS CALL THE NEW SILK ROAD RAILWAY 

DURING THE NINETEEN NINETIES JAPANESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND TOKYO AS A FINANCIAL CENTER HAVE BEEN THE LAME DUCK OF THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL COMMUNITY AND HERE WE HAVE A POLITICAL LEADER WHO SEIZES THE INITIATIVE AND WANTS TO PUSH TOKYO AS A FINANCIAL CENTER WAY UP TO THE FOREFRONT AGAIN 

OVER THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS WITH THE VARIOUS FINANCIAL CRISES THAT HAVE BEEN HITTING JAPAN A STRONG CONSENSUS HAS BEEN BUILT THAT CHANGE NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT ABOUT CHANGE IS COMING FROM THE CENTER AND AS A RESULT OF THAT I THINK PROSPECTS ARE VERY GOOD THAT THE CHANGE WILL BE FAST THAT THE CHANGE WILL BE DEEP AND THAT IN THE END BY THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND AND ONE TOKYO IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE STRONGEST FINANCIAL CENTERS IN ASIA 

HE OBLITERATED THE AN ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH YOU CAN LOOK WITH SOME OPTIMISM TOWARDS A MIDDLE EASTERN COMMUNITY 

FROM WHAT ONE CAN GATHER IS THAT BOTH THE OFFICIAL AND AND THE PRIVATE ARAB POSITION IN THIS CONFERENCE IS NOT TO DEAL WITH THE ISRAELIS 

THERE IS NOBODY ELSE TO BLAME BUT NETANYAHU HE IS THE NEW SCAPEGOAT FOR EVERYTHING THAT GOES WRONG IN THE MIDDLE EAST 

IT IS A PROJECT IT IS AN ENTERPRISE IT IS A VISION AND LIKE ALL VISIONS IT NEEDS CERTAIN INGREDIENTS TO MAKE IT WORK AND THE INGREDIENTS ARE HALF THERE AND THE CONFERENCES ARE TRYING TO PROVIDE THIS OTHER HALF THEN COMES THIS GRAND SPOILER NETANYAHU AND HE NOT ONLY FREES THAT OTHER POTENTIAL BUT HE ACTUALLY UNDERMINES THE ASSETS OF THE FIRST HALF THAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS 

AND I AM EDDIE MAIR IN LONDON 

ALSO INDIA MOURNS THE VICTIMS OF THE WORLD'S WORST MIDAIR COLLISION 

PLUS TOO MANY ELEPHANTS IN SOUTH AFRICA CONTRACEPTIVES MAY BE THE ANSWER 

IF IT WORKS IN ELEPHANTS LIKE IT WORKS IN EVERYTHING ELSE THEY WILL BE UNABLE TO CONCEIVE OF BABIES FOR A YEAR 

FIRST THIS NEWS 

TIME NOW TO SADDLE UP YOUR CAMEL AND RIDE OUT INTO THE DESERT IN SEARCH OF TODAY'S MYSTERY 

PEOPLE LIVED HERE FOR CENTURIES A MILLENNIA IN FACT THE OASIS SITS ON THE OLD SILK ROUTE LINKING CHINA TO EUROPE DURING THE MIDDLE AGES TRADERS FROM EVERY CORNER OF THE WORLD PASSED THROUGH THIS PLACE 

AND THE GOVERNMENT IN CHINA STOPPED THE TRADERS COMING THROUGH THIS OASIS SOME TIME AGO FOR SECURITY REASONS IN RECENT YEARS THIS IS WHERE THE CHINESE MILITARY CONDUCTED ITS NUCLEAR
